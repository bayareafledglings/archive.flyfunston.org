	<ol>
      <li><strong>Site Management:</strong>&nbsp;The       Funston Training bowl is property of The Olympic Club (Golf Course) and is       managed by the Golden Gate National Recreation Area (GGNRA). The Fellow       Feathers of Fort Funston Hang Gliding Club has been authorized by the       GGNRA to manage hang gliding activities in the Funston Training Bowl. The       Fellow Feathers appoints a Training Bowl Director to oversee these       activities.</li>
         <li><strong>Instructors</strong>:       Must be a current USHPA Certified Instructor. Each instructor will be       directly responsible for their students.</li>
         <li><strong>Authorization:&nbsp;</strong>Instructors       must contact the Training Bowl Director and receive authorization before teaching       at the Funston Training Bowl.</li>
         <li><strong>Revocation:&nbsp;</strong>The       Funston Training Bowl Director or any club officer can, for cause, revoke       an instructor or students authorization to use the training bowl.</li>
         <li><strong>Commercial use:</strong>&nbsp;Commercial       training/instruction is not permitted.</li>
         <li><strong>Site Closure:</strong>&nbsp;The       Training Bowl Director or a Fellow Feathers Club Officer may close the       Training Bowl if they have determined that the conditions are not suitable       for training.</li>
         <li><strong>Boundary</strong>:       The Funston Training Bowl is the area directly west of the Olympic Club       golf course and extending west to the Pacific Ocean. The northern boundary       is the GGNRA/Olympic Club golf course property line, and the south end is       the cliff at the edge of the eroded area of the golf course.</li>
         <li><strong>Access to training area:</strong>&nbsp;Take the sand trail that is immediately south of       the Fort Funston launch to the beach. From there, walk south to the       Training Bowl landing zone and walk up area.</li>
         <li><strong>Paragliding</strong>:       Paraglider training or instruction is not permitted.</li>
         <li><strong>Gear</strong>:       &nbsp;Each instructor must carry a knife with a sharp point that can cut       sail cloth, and robust wire cutters in case of a water landing rescue.</li>
         <li><strong>Students must have the following:</strong></li>
         <ol start="1" type="1">
           <li>Current USHPA membership with a minimum H1 rating.</li>
           <li>Site orientation from the Training Bowl Director or a        USHPA Certified Instructor.</li>
           <li>Sign-off for 90 degree turns and cross wind landings.</li>
           <li>A hook knife attached to their harness.</li>
         </ol>

         <li><strong>Beginner (H1) and Novice (H2) rated students must be under an Instructors supervision to fly in the Training Bowl.</strong></li>
         <li><strong>Glider Limitations:</strong>&nbsp;No       more than 5 gliders may train in the Bowl at any one time.</li>
         <li><strong>Caution</strong>:       Uneven ground, high tide, and gliders with a better than average glide       ratio can contribute to challenging or dangerous conditions. A straight       glide towards the ocean is not advisable; Always turn before reaching the       water line! Make sure there is plenty of beach available and that it's       clear before launching: Do not launch if there are people or horses in the       landing area.</li>
         <li><strong>Other</strong>:       Be courteous to other park visitors, they have the right-of-way. Pick up       and carry out your trash.</li></ol>
