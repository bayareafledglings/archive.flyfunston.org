				<h3>Meeting Minutes 2-8-2011</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Tue Feb 08, 2011 11:24 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>fakeDecoy</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Attendees: Dave K, Eric M, Tom R, Larry C, Chris V, Chuck K, Tim W, Damien D, Thomas C, Ted L, Kathy O, Raffy L, Charlie N, Van P, Diev H, Mike J<br /><br />Notable flights: Not much reported. There was a shear yesterday, but due to various reasons nobody was able to take advantage of it.<br /><br />Clubhouse Mgr: Charlie will change the clubhouse lock when the meeting is over. New keys were mailed out. Contact him if you haven't received your new key.<br /><br />Tech Officer: We have a new server room in the Ropes building available to us for the webcam there and maybe more webcams or something.<br /><br />Discussion of GGNRA dog management plan. See more info at the other post linked below. Steve encourages pilots to send in their comments to GGNRA and express support for the plan GGNRA marked as the &quot;preferred alternative C&quot; plan, which has certain on-leash and off-leash dog areas.<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopicf804.html?f=5&amp;t=1087">viewtopic.php.html?f=5&amp;t=1087</a><!-- l --><br /><br />Proposal to vote for bylaw change, ARTICLE XII, having to do with the posting of notice of bylaw amendments. Proposal seconded. Vote passed. One more vote at the next meeting is required to make the change. See below link for more info on the proposed change.<br /><!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic4abb.html?f=5&amp;t=1090">viewtopic.php.html?f=5&amp;t=1090</a><!-- l --><br /><br />Further discussion on the aforementioned bylaw change. If the vote passes next meeting, the idea is to post any upcoming bylaw change notices on the forum here. Suggestion was made that anyone who wishes to receive an announcement of such notices by email can subscribe to the forum topic to receive alerts of any new posts. Suggestion to create a topic specifically for all such bylaw change notices.<br /><br />Damien brought up a discussion of some biwingual paragliders possibly landing at Funston, or at a certain part of Funston, and relaunching. Paragliders currently aren't allowed to do so under conditions of the Fellow Feathers' Special Use Permit with GGNRA due to safety issues. Discussion of the tight soarable airspace available on the Funston ridge on many days. Discussion of whether it's appropriate to attempt some sort of limited access trial plan, and whether having the Feds approve such a change to the special use permit will pave the way to making it a fully biwingual site.<br /><br />President Tom brought up upcoming BBQ possibilities. We don't want to conflict with the Ed Levin speed gliding event. Send suggestions to Tom. Mike J offered to help with the grilling when the time comes.<br /><br />Meeting adjourned.</div>
