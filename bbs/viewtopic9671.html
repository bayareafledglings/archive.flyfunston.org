				<h3>Fountain Relocation Project</h3>

				<div class="content">Fountain Relocation Project<br /><br />The project goal as discussed at past club meetings: To reduce the interaction of dogs and pedestrians with hang gliders by moving the drinking fountain and dog water station 200’ north from its existing location to the NW corner of the main parking lot. <br /><br />For those who have missed the recent discussions, please see below for today’s update that I sent to the FF Board.<br />The Fellow Feathers will complete all construction through volunteer work. Please contact me off-line if you can help with trench digging, PVC pipe installation, or general help with the construction or traffic control.<br />Thanks!<br />Steve R.<br /><br />“3-2-2011<br />Hi guys,<br />I met with GGNRA maintenance ranger Pat Kocer today at Fort Funston.<br />We confirmed the location of the water main shut off valve but discovered that the valve access is blocked with sand. Pat is going to clear it out and also track down the big T-wrench we need for shutting it off.<br />Access to this valve will now eliminate the water valve at the old fountain location so I modified our relocation proposal to the GGNRA, please see attached. The project is supported by GGNRA so hopefully it should not take too long for approval.<br />Once the proposal is approved we can coordinate the start day of our construction with Pat to get use of the T-wrench.<br />Tom, were you able to get any volunteers at the last club meeting to help with trench digging and other needs?<br />Steve”</div>

				<div class="content">BTW, The Fountain Relocation Proposal I wrote for the GGNRA is quite detailed in its description of the phases of construction and could be of interest to anyone wanting to volunteer with the move.<br /><br />The proposal contains personal contact info and license numbers (required by the GGNRA) so it will not be available online or to the general public.<br /><br />It is available to Voting Members of the Fellow Feathers and I’ll bring a hard copy to the next meeting if anyone would like to check it out.<br /><br />We will be digging and backfilling a 200’ long trench so please consider lending a hand. Dates to be announced!</div>

				<div class="content">We got the 200' of water line in today! All I have left to do is meet with the inspector on Wednesday and make the final connection. Thanks to everyone who chipped in. Lots of guys stopped for a short time, too many to list, (and I didn't get all the names) The main players besides myself were Ward who burrowed the pipe under the boardwalk and his equipment operator Ben who dug the trench, Eric H. who got materials at contractor price, Diver Dave, Charlie N. and Larry C. Thanks to everyone who lent a hand!<br /><br />I plumbed the water line so we could leave the old fountain working until a time when we can move it in one day. Hopefully that day will be within the next one or two weeks. We will need another volunteer team to do that work so please keep watching this thread for a date when you can lend a hand.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">It's been cold and damp at the Fort since I set the new fountain in place, but if the concrete is hard enough I will activate it tomorrow evening!<br /><br />I plan on removing the old fountain early next week and some park visitors might not know where to go for water. Would everyone please keep an eye out for people looking for the fountain and point them in the right direction? Thanks!<br /><br />If anyone asks why the old one was removed: The new fountain meets requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and creates more room for all park visitors.<br /><br />Back story details: The old fountain was falling apart and leaking, was handicap prohibitive, and its location created a conflict between dogs and hang gliders.<br /><br />Cheers!<br />Steve</div>

				<div class="content">update:  the  old  fountain  is gone ,  bless its  wooden   soul .  and the  new  one  is  a  shining  tribute to Fellow Feathers' hope to  reduce  friction and increase  cooperation  between the  two main  user  groups at funston ,  dog walkers and  HG pilots.<br /> the  dogs  have as much  fun at  Funston as the pilots. <br />If  dogs  could  talk and drink  ,  we'd all meet   for a beer  each  evening to  swap  stories and wag tails.<br /><br />her's  hoping the  dog  walkers get   one tenth as much enjoyment.  <br /><br />anyone have  comments  about the new  fountain location?<br /><br />I think it's  working well  to separate  the slobber  from  the  dacron. <br /><br />thanks  to the many who  helped  to get this job  done.<br />also to Fellow  Feathers  for  funding it  very   conservatively.<br />  it is a benefit to  the handicapped  people  who visit the  Fort.</div>
