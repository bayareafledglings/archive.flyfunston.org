				<div class="content">The &quot;no aerobatics&quot; rule was removed by club vote on 12-8-2009, effectively allowing aerobatics that is not done in the launch window or by the observation deck. There was never a subsequent vote to reinstate the rule. I bring this up because the latest rule sheet has this rule added back on erroneously. The forum won't allow me to attach pdf files.

				<div class="content">Well crap, I thought I'd dropped rule # 13 by accident so I put it back in. I thought I made a mistake but I was mistaken!<br /><br />Our GGNRA Special Use Permit has rule # 13 written into it: “Stunt flying and aerobatics are prohibited.” (They pretty much take our rules and embed them into the SUP when they write it)<br />The thing is that the club can’t change our SUP simply by voting on it. It is a written contract and any change has to be negotiated and agreed upon by the GGNRA. I don't know how this concept slipped by us three years ago but I’d say that we need to reconsider our actions, especially in light of recent events that shine a spotlight on this area.<br /><br />Rule # 4 covers the launch window just fine, but we should consider how rule # 13 might protect the high profile bowl just south of the sand trail.<br />How about we put our heads together and discuss this at the August meeting?</div>
