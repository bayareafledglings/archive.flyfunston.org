				<div class="content">The Fellow Feathers is cordially invited to come to the Silent Airshow that will be held Sunday September 19th at Ed Levin Park in Milpitas, CA.
<br />
<br />The Wings of Rogallo club will be helping to organize it but we want
<br />as many clubs, pilots, family members, and friends to come to the
<br />event as possible and for those willing to help it make it happen.
<br />
<br />The last one was held in back in 1991. At its best showing there were over 8000 guests, so this is a big, really big event. We want all the clubs in the region to come on over and of course anyone else beyond as well. There will be flying from 8am to 3pm with a continuous flow of vehicles driving up to launch. Besides hang gliding there will be paragliding, sail planes, sky diving, hot air balloons, and RC planes.
<br />
<br />There will be many acts, and we welcome you to come with one or more
<br />of your own.
<br />
<br />The entire event will start off with a sanctioned Speed Gliding event
<br />that will start Friday the 17th, and will continue thru the mornings
<br />of the 18th and 19th.
<br />
<br />On Sunday, the big day, other activities like a spot landing contest,
<br />aerobatics (possibly by the Red Bull team), synchronized flying,
<br />candy drops for the kids, and much more happen.
<br />
<br />Please come and support this event.
<br />
