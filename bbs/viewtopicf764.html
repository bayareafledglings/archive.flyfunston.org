				<div class="content">Meeting minutes October 9, 2012<br /><br />Attendees:<br />Chris Valley<br />Rob Johnson<br />Tracey Story<br />Diev Hart<br />Steve Rodrigues<br />Ted Lipke<br />Larry Carpenter<br />Tom Rust<br />Jim Mueller<br />Rafael Lavin<br />Chuck Kranz<br />Patrick Pannese<br />Mark Lilledahl<br />Jeff Bohl<br />David Kiesling<br /><br />Topics discussed:<br /><br />Replacing the rusted information sign about HG on the observation deck with<br />one that has a means for a visitor to see more about hang gliding. Also<br />discussed including a QR code on new signs that visitors can find the Fellow<br />Feathers with their smart phones. <br /><br />Discussed asking the GGNRA or dog walker's group to take over maintenance of<br />the drinking fountain.<br /><br />Asked pilots not to leave cash for their dues in the set up area. Leave it<br />in the clubhouse or with an officer instead who will then give it to the<br />Treasurer. <br /><br />Some pilots asked that a copy of Fellow Feather's rules be stapled to<br />membership forms so that when they sign that they've read the rules, we know<br />that they've received them. The membership forms that are in the green chest<br />do not include a copy of the rules. <br /><br />Setting up a permanent address for the club to receive mail at instead of<br />using officer's home addresses. Steve is going to put up a temporary mailbox<br />and send a test piece of mail to it to ensure its delivered. If successful,<br />he's going to have a mail slot installed in the club's door so that all club<br />mail can be mailed to the clubhouse.<br /><br />Chuck is continuing improvements on the database with Daniel Mizyrycki. <br /><br />A motion was passed to waive 20 hour requirement so Jeff Bohl can get a<br />clubhouse space. Jeff lives in Texas, but is a United Airlines pilot and<br />visits the bay area often.<br /><br />A motion was passed to waive Ted Lipke's membership fee for 2012 due to<br />financial hardship. <br /><br />A motion was passed for Adam Williams (space 27) and Patrick Dow (space 48)<br />to lose their clubhouse spaces due to being unreachable and not paying their<br />2012 dues. Also, no one at the meeting has seen either of them for an<br />extended period of time. Their gliders were put up in the impound rack and<br />are subject to auction. <br /><br />A $100 donation was mailed to the club from a woman who was thankful that<br />Tom White spread her Aunt BJ's ashes at the Fort. Tom's kind gesture<br />received a round of applause.<br /><br />Motion to adjourn passed.</div>
