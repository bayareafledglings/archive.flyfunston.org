<br />
<br />now that i've got everyone's attention=)
<br />
<br />The following proposal will be presented to the Club this evening, please come and support this effort, a large cooler full of FREE BEER will be provided to loosen tongues.
<br />
<br />A well managed the clubhouse can be a great tool for club members, and has the potential to grow the number of active pilots at Funston, as glider logistics are a huge barrier to new pilots. 
<br />
<br />In order to accomplish the goal of providing clubhouse glider spaces to pilots that actually Fly Funston, as opposed to being cheap storage for non-flying members, I propose that we vote to move forward on the following items:
<br />
<br />- The Club decides on a concrete standard on how often a pilot needs to fly Funston to have a slot, and enforce it: If a pilot does not fly at Fort Funston at least x times a month during the flying season, for x consecutive months, they forfeit their slot, and their glider will be moved to the graveyard.
<br />
<br />- The Clubhouse Manager notifies current slot holders by email/letter to, as well as posting a notice in the Clubhouse, stating the standard and that it will be enforced rigorously.
<br />
<br />- The Clubhouse Manager sends an email/letter to existing slot holders, asking them if they have flown at Funston within the last 6 months. If they have not, or if no response is received after 2 emails/letters, they forfeit their slot and their glider is moved to the graveyard. In this letter we offer to provide free-of-charge glider transportation from the clubhouse to a location of choice in the Bay Area. This service will be provided by Clubhouse Waiting List members. 
<br />
<br />- The Clubhouse Manager provides a publicly posted waiting list.
<br />
<br />Thanks for considering, 
<br />
<br />Waiting List Members, who will be providing FREE BEER.
<br />
