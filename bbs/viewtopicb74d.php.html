<br />The new H-2 Rules need refinement.
<br />1. The only grounds for suspending the sponsor for the H-2’s violation should be for sponsoring a flight by a pilot that the sponsor knew or should have known was unqualified.

<br />In regard to the rule
<br />
<br />F) If an H-2 violates any Fellow Feathers rule during their sponsored flight, their sponsor shall be subject to the same suspension.
<br />
<br />The problem we are trying to solve: H-2 pilots not knowing all the rules and their sponsors not taking responsibility for the H-2 they are sponsoring.
<br />
<br />This rule insures that the sponsor will take extra care to be sure the H-2 knows and agrees to follow the rules.
<br />
<br />A suspension means little to an H-2 who doesn't' fly the Fort anyway so there is not much effective repercussion for an H-2 who breaks a rule. But how many H-2's would want to suffer the consequences if they got a respected Funston regular suspended along with them? They could essentially be shunned from the site, so this is one case where peer pressure would be very useful.
<br />
<br />My opinion is that if someone is not confident the H-2 both knows and will follow the rules they shouldn't sponsor them!
<br />
<br />Please note, the rule says the sponsor shall be &quot;subject to&quot; suspension, not &quot;shall be&quot; suspended. This allows discretion by the Board to consider extenuating circumstances.</div>

				<div class="content">Making the sponsor subject to the same suspension as the H-2 insures that the sponsor will not report a violation by the H-2 because it will mean his suspension. If the H-2 disregards the sponsor’s instructions and violates the rules, the sponsor should not be suspended. In ancient Babylon when the patient died, the doctor was killed. It reduced malpractice but greatly limited medical care.
<br />
<br />An H-2 will not be concerned about getting a “respected regular suspended.” But for one &quot;extraordinary&quot; pilot with “incredible aplomb, intelligence and tolerance”, the rest of us are “crusty” and “immature”.</div>
