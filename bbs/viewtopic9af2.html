				<div class="content">Hi all,
<br />
<br />I'm working on improving the webcam.  As part of the process I'd like to upgrade to Windows XP, preferably the Pro edition.  Can anyone donate a legit copy of XP and a license key or two?  Due to all of the authentication checking in XP/IE 7 there can be only one PC running under each license number.
<br />
<br />Please email me offline at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:webcamdonation@flyfunston.org">webcamdonation@flyfunston.org</a><!-- e --> (temporary email address to avoid the spam).
<br />
<br />Many thanks,
<br />

<br />I actually have two XP pro’s, a 98se and a Norton Antivirus 2004 I can donate to the club. I’m hoping this could count as credits of some sort for the upcoming purgatory auction…
<br />I have another complete working 98se system I can donate also but I think last time you guys attained a few to use as backups?
<br />Want to meet at the fort tomorrow?

<br />Hi. This is the qmail-send program at yahoo.com.
<br />I'm afraid I wasn't able to deliver your message to the following 
<br />addresses.
<br />This is a permanent error; I've given up. Sorry it didn't work out.
<br />
<br />&lt;webcamdonation@flyfunston.org&gt;:
<br />216.193.217.198 does not like recipient.
<br />Remote host said: 550-"The recipient cannot be verified.  Please check 
<br />all recipients of this
<br />550 message to verify they are valid."....
<br />
<br />have you tested it? Is it my mozilla? let me know if I can help...

				<div class="content">Hey Diev,
<br />
<br />That's generous of you.  Thanks.
<br />
<br />Yep, I made a typo in the email setup.  It's fixed now.  Thanks for the heads up.  I'll get in touch offline.  You can use my personal email too, I just don't want to post it in a public forum.
<br />
<br />I have a donated PC, I'm mainly interested in the XP Pro software.  We're going to be using ethernet and wireless and usb, so XP is the way to go.  I'll give you a call/email to discuss.
<br />
<br />The glider auction won't be until October, so the timing probably won't work out.  On the other hand, we may be incorporating this year into a non-profit corporation, so donations will be tax deductible.  You can use that cash towards a glider purchase!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.html" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />
