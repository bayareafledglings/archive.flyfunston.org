				<div class="content">Tom,<br />As a H2 you can not land back up on top, meaning you can launch, do one pass to the right (north) to the drain pipe, and then go south.....go as far south as you like (dumps...(but do not do this by yourself please)) and fly there but do not come back for a top landing at For Funston (or anywhere north of the bowl)...go land on the beach (after hours of flying down at the dumps).....then hike it up and do it again.....<br /><br />What are you missing for your H3?<br />Diev</div>

				<div class="content">Here's the H2 FF rules:<br /><br />10. All H-2 flights shall be supervised by a Sponsor approved by a majority of the Executive Committee. On their first four (4) flights, an H-2 must glide directly to the beach without attempting to soar. On subsequent flights, H-2’s may soar only if approved to do so by their Sponsor.<br />a) All H-2 flights, from launch to landing, shall be under direct supervision of their Sponsor.<br />b) H-2 pilots shall be limited to smooth winds of 15 mph or less, and gusty winds of 10 mph or less. Wind shall not be more than 15 degrees cross.<br />c) H-2's may fly only as far north as the drain pipe just north of launch, and only as far south as the south end of the training bowl below the golf course.<br />d) H-2’s must land on the beach. (No top landings).<br />e) H-2's must fly a bright colored 6’ streamer from their kingpost.<br />f) If an H-2 violates any Fellow Feathers rule during their sponsored flight, their Sponsor shall be subject to the same suspension.<br />g) Only one H-2 may be in the air at any one time. H-2 flights shall be limited to 30 minutes if another H-2 pilot is waiting to launch.<br /><br /><a href="../documents/FF%20Rules%20rev%203-8-2011.html" class="postlink">http://flyfunston.org/documents/FF%20Rules%20rev%203-8-2011.pdf</a></div>

				<div class="content">Good Ol'  Tom will follow the  rules  and not go  south of the  bowl or north of the  pipe . <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> <br />Tom you can get a 1/2 hour or more  each time you launch, if conditions are right .   The  carry up is  not too hard.<br />and it's fun to land on the beach.</div>
