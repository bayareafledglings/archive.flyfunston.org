				<div class="content">Dear friends,
<br />
<br />This June 5th, Crestline Soaring Society is hosting the CSS/SoCal Regional Hang Glider Aerobatics Competition in conjunction with our Presidential Citation Celebration BBQ for Owen Morse.
<br />
<br />I would like to invite you to participate!
<br />
<br />The competition will be held on the afternoon of the BBQ. It’s FREE to enter! However, participants are required to purchase a smoke bomb (at approximately our cost) for $10. This event is a one-run event. Best performance wins. There is an Open Class and a Sportsman Class. The Sportsman Class is for first time aerobatic competitors, and beautiful hand-blown glass trophies (created by world-renowned glass artist and our USHPA President Lisa Tate) will be awarded to the winners of both classes!
<br />
<br />Everyone - even single-surface pilots! - are encouraged to participate. Aerobatics competitions help promote the sport of hang gliding in a good light to new and younger audiences! So come out and wang it up!
<br />
<br />If you’re interested in competing, please email me at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:rod@rodclark.com">rod@rodclark.com</a><!-- e --> right away!
<br />
<br />Advance registration will help us secure the appropriate number of smoke bombs and shuttles to launch! Also, I can provide aerobatics rules and regulations via email to anyone interested in competing so you can maximize your score during your performance.
<br />
<br />Come fly! Come celebrate! Come BBQ! Come Wang!</div>
