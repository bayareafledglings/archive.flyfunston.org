				<h3>Clubhouse rules change - passed Oct 10 2006</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Fri Dec 08, 2006 10:41 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Hey guys,
<br />
<br />We've been discussing exactly this for a few years.  There are several steps that had to be taken to get where we want to be:
<br />
<br />1. Organize the clubhouse records so we know who is in there, who has/hasn't paid, who is on the waiting list, and so forth.  Jonas Barbour and Chris Valley (clubhouse guys for the last 3 years) now have all memberships in a spreadsheet and the renewal process is more regular than in the past.
<br />
<br />2. Remove gliders from non-paying members - done, 2 years ago
<br />
<br />3. Remove gliders from clearly non-flying members, e.g. ones that live out of state - done, in the last 2 years
<br />
<br />4. Organize and identify abandoned or unused gliders.  Have pilots remove those gliders or sell them off - done, with an auction just a couple of months ago
<br />
<br />The next step is to identify pilots who don't fly at Funston regularly.  We discussed this back and forth over many meetings.  At the October 10, 2006 meeting we adjusted the Clubhouse rules to only allow &quot;active&quot; members to store gliders, where &quot;active&quot; is defined as &quot;a pilot who flies at Fort Funston at least 3 times per calendar year.&quot; (quoted from the new Clubhouse rules).  
<br />
<br />This change applies to the 2007 calendar year.  By the end of 2007, at the latest, the board will be justified in asking inactive pilots to remove their gliders.  
<br />
<br />All in all I believe we've had 10-ish spots turn over in the last 2 years.  With this new rule in place I imagine we'll get a handful more.  
<br />
<br />Beyond that - well, we need to build an addition on the clubhouse!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.html" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />

				<div class="content">The first step is for those who no longer fly to step up to the plate and kindly give up their spot...that has happened with a few individuals who recognize the importance of opening up a space for those who fly the Fort regularly, and I've assigned the available spot(s) to those on the waiting list as this has occurred.  I've also approached these people and have been having luck in obtaining additional spots for those in need...
<br />
<br />We have a few pilots on the waiting list as I type.  Some of these people fly the Fort regularly, some do not.  I assign glider spaces to those who are on the waiting list AND fly the Fort on a regulary basis, not those who have simply been on the waiting list the longest...
<br />
<br />Is that fair?  Yes.  It is fair to those who really need a glider space and fly the Fort regularly...
<br />
<br />The funny thing about Diev's post is that a glider spot opened up and Diev now has a spot in the clubhouse!   <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.html" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /> How timely...you're welcome Diev!  
<br />
<br />As Daniel mentioned, we now have more of a process to weed out those who fly vs. those who simply take up space at the clubhouse.  Within time we'll have other glider spots available, and soon I believe.

				<div class="content">Here are the current people on the waiting list for a glider spot:
<br />
<br />Danny Alexander
<br />Mohammed (Don't have his last name right now)
<br />Brian Foster
<br />Gwaenal Jacq
<br />Ian Darnel
<br />
<br />When I first took over the role as clubhouse president, I was able to get the initial list of waiting pilots a spot in the clubhouse.  The current list represents those who have told me in the last year or so that they'd like a spot...and, yes, they fly Funston regularly...some may actually <span style="font-style: italic">live</span> there!  <img src="images/smilies/icon_lol.gif" alt=":lol:" title="Laughing" /> 
<br />
<br />It takes time to open up a spot in this club for glider storage.  Our goal for 2007 is to open up more glider spaces by finding out who is flying regularly and who isn't...my comment about giving preference to pilots who fly regularly is not off the mark from the current policy the club has about who does or does not receive a glider spot...Diev is right, though, there are a lot of gliders simply being stored and collecting dust...these need to go and slowly they are going...
<br />
<br />For the time being, the club is putting a hold on adding more people to the waiting list until the above-mentioned individuals receive a spot...
<br />
<br />Happy Holidays!
