<br />I hereby invite all you North Bay Area folks to comeout and become a big gang of powered and UNPOWERED hanggliders in the sky over Tracy, Calif. Post some messages to the yahoo group and it will happen near Mt Diablo and NOT waaay down by Salinas. ( your participation will influence the location)
<br />
<br />Even if you bring a body and no wing - you will still get some airtime fix.
<br />
<br />Feb 19, 2005: Nathalie and Carl - Paul and Ken did the clinic in Tracy. Here's what dave and Lindy did:

<br />Feb 26, 2005: clear skies and....Towing! You guys NEED to determine if it shall be at NewJew or MerceyHS. Post a message today, that we may know if the majority of guys are coming from MorroBay/Gilroy or from Livermore/Fairfield/Davis and plan for the appropiate place. You guys get to decide!
<br />It is rumored that Gregg Minolli (ApacheTrike) may want to tug us too.
<br />(I still have two other guys with "non-weight shift" tugs)

<br />(from the AT_NorCal group)
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;Hi Folks,
<br /> 
<br />I spoke to Kenny Brown and agreeed to come out and
<br />1) Do some Tandems for folks who do not have their AT rating.
<br />2) Help out as ground crew on the cart end of the operation.
<br />     - mostly for the folks who are somewhat new to aerotowing.
<br /> 
<br />The shall be no solo flying for folks that do not have their AT rating,
<br />with the exception of Nathallie who has the experience but not the paperwork.
<br />I will be giving pointers and checking safety issues.
<br />I will not be doing a ground school.
<br /> 
<br />Come on out - I will try and do about 8 tows.
<br />Nathallie and Mark are on the priority list.
<br /> 
<br />Any other interest ?
<br /> 
<br />Ben.</div>
