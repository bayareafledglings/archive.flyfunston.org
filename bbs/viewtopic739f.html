There have been problems with theft. The perpetrator have been<br />identified and property returned. Do NOT loan your key to anyone - it's grounds for<br />suspension.<br /><br />There was a discussion about options (related to thefts), which eventually settled on putting<br />security cameras in the clubhouse. An extended debate followed about local-<br />storage systems vs. online systems (Ring) followed. Steve raised the motion to<br />acquire a Ring security system, Seconded (Ron), and the motion carried unanimously.<br /><br />From March;<br /><ul><li>Maps - Steve came in with an abbreviated map, which will be added to the bylaws and made available at Funston.</li><li>Maps - Ron's maps will also be available at Funston, for anyone curious about the specifics.</li></ul><br />Rob (President)<br /><ul><li>Rob and Steve met w/ Coast Guard to train them in what to do if they have to deal w/ a hang glider crash. Talked about where to cut/not to cut a glider and harness, parachute handles, etc.</li><li>There are a couple gliders in purgatory - have been for years. We're trying to sort out what to do with them.

Should we purchase a decent mower?</li><li>There's a dealer/repairman of used mowers in Daly City that we'll contact about a possible option.</li></ul><br />Brad Martin (Safety Officer)<br /><ul><li>Keep an eye on glider maintenance, everyone. (When was the last time you replaced your side wires?)</li><li>If you're doing repairs or any kind of work, make sure a pro does or inspects it!!!</li></ul><br />Misc;<br /><ul><li>Everyone is short on stickers; Steve, Rob, The Box.
