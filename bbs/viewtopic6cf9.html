				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Minutes<br />Fellow Feathers Meeting <br />February 8, 2005</span>
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">• DVD</span>
<br />Watched the film by Nick Davila: Flying Off Mountains
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">• Annual Report</span>
<br />Presented the “What we did in 2004 and plan to do in 2005” report ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../flyfunston.org/2004-2005.html">http://flyfunston.org/2004-2005.php.html</a><!-- m --> )
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">• Tandem: </span>The plan for allowing non-commercial tandems at Funston
<br />
<br />- Steve R. presented the proposed rules that we sent into GGNRA.  They’re online at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../flyfunston.org/bbs/viewtopicb60c.html?t=147">http://flyfunston.org/bbs/viewtopic.php.html?t=147</a><!-- m --> .  Discussion points that came up:
<br />
<br />&#61607;	People are mostly in favor of this
<br />&#61607;	Q: What exactly is a Tandem Instructor? A: Third level of tandem HG, above T-2 and T-1. Allows you to take student USHGA members who sign up on the spot and get a temporary membership card.  Allows you more judgement calls, e.g. the weight of the student. Requires you to have a first aid certification.
<br />&#61607;	Can a pilot from somewhere else just come and fly here? A: No. They must be signed off by the Tandem Director, which means they also have to have solo Funston experience.  See the guide for the Tandem Director on the Rules page above.
<br />&#61607;	Does a tandem flying at Westlake on a fat day count as 1 glider in the air? A: Yes, for now.  We will probably revisit this later.
<br />
<br />- Consequences should be in writing.  To a certain extent they are – pilots can have their Funston Tandem or even Funston sticker privileges pulled.
<br />
<br />- What does it take to be a tandem instructor? See the USHGA proficiency program ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.ushga.org/hgtand.asp">http://www.ushga.org/hgtand.asp</a><!-- m --> ).  The hard part is getting other pilots to go tandem with you.
<br />- Motion to approve the rules as written as our proposal to GGNRA: seconded, voted and approved.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">• Webcam</span>
<br />
<br />- Thanks to Rick for fixing the online wind and webcam.  HOWEVER, we request a more interesting picture in front of the camera while it’s being repaired.
<br />- Many people didn’t know that this computer and the wind readings were taken from Dave Sondergold’s attic
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">• Waiting list and clubhouse </span>
<br />
<br />- Jonas sent off the clubhouse applications for 2005.  Everyone is paying $40 when they have 2 spots.  We have 30 back. 18 people have 2 spots.
<br />- We have 4 people on the waiting list.  
<br />- We are missing several policy issues:
<br />&#61607;	Overall, Daniel wants to see a new policy document by the end of 2005.  Since Jonas is in the middle of sending out keys we’re not going to overload him with more work right now.
<br />&#61607;	2 spots = $40
<br />&#61607;	Should we allow double spots even?
<br />&#61607;	What about people who don’t fly regularly?
<br />&#61607;	If there’s no waiting list, then having 2 spots isn’t an issue. 
<br />
<br />- Valid reasons for having 2 spots: gliders get wrecked if someone takes your glider out to get at theirs; pilot actually uses both gliders on a regular basis; other valid reasons?  Long term storage shouldn't be one of them.
<br />- Steve R. proposes there be a moratorium on giving a 2nd spot to someone who already has a spot. Motion: One member one glider.  Grandfather everyone who’s already in. If there are 10 additional spots with no waiting list, then we can give spots to someone who already has a spot in the clubhouse.  Voted and approved.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">• South launch</span>
<br />
<br />- Larry needs better shovels / pitchforks.  Motion to authorize 4 implements.  Voted and approved.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">• No Parking Signs and red paint around clubhouse door</span>
<br />
<br />- Problem: non-pilots keep blocking the doorway to the clubhouse. 
<br />- Solution: Signs on the wall and red paint on the ground.  Concrete paint/driveway paint – just in front of the access door
<br />- Steve – doing the paint and signs
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">• Windsock pole</span>
<br />
<br />- Larry wants to wrap it with PVC tape.  Don’t we want something that we can see through?  Larry wants to put contact cement on the joint and wrap it with PVC tape.  Motion made, voted, approved. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">• Other receipts.</span>
<br />
<br />- Jonas - $98.10 for clubhouse
<br />- Daniel – photocopying 
<br />- Daniel – web hosting
<br />- Tom - $148 for pipe and insulation.  The racks rock.  Works out to $8.33 per pair of spots.  Motion to authorize Tom to do as many as he can.  Voted and approved.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Treasurer’s Report</span>
