				<div class="content">Hi all,
<br />
<br />Next Saturday (Sept 15th) is the Coastal Cleanup Day.  It's a volunteer event for, um, cleaning up the coast. It would be both environmentally conscious and a good gesture to the GGNRA for a group of hang glider pilots to come out and clean up. I'm thinking we'd start another base location at Funston with some of us cleaning up top and most cleaning along the beach. 
<br />
<br />Anyone else interested in coming out to clean before an afternoon of flying? Post here or send me an email (<a href="../officers.php.html" class="postlink">http://flyfunston.org/officers.php.html</a> ) if you're interested.  Please feel free to get the word out.  
<br />
<br />Daniel

				<div class="content">Hi all,
<br />
<br />Anyone who wants to get out and clean should register and meet with the main tables either at the foot of Sloat or further north across from the Beach Chalet (where there will be entertainment and what not).  My family and I will grab gear there and head over to Funston or the parking lot near the stables at the base of John Daly Blvd.
