				<h3>Democracy for Fellow Feathers</h3>

				<div class="content">The special hearing meeting last Wednesday slammed home to me a sad lesson - the lack of turnout of club officers - for reasons which I can totally understand, as I sure did NOT want to be there.<br />I am also increasingly disturbed by the lack of communication which is engendered by the fact that MOST of the members of the club DON'T come to the club meetings.<br />But there are some relatively simple solutions which would enable the entire membership to participate, no matter where they are.<br /><br />I'm thinking of some of the online survey and election systems - for example ballotbin.com, which allow any group to create an election or survey, with time constraints and various voter feedback mechanisms.<br />Its simple, its fast, and its relatively foolproof. Anyone with an email adress, and even those that don't, can use it.<br /><br />I am thinking there would be 3 timeframes of elections:<br />- 30minute -<br />- 1 month<br />- 1+ month<br /><br />For example, at every club meeting we spend the first 30m and tally any requests for the 30m vote. So from 7:30-8 we collect that and input it. At 8 oclock, voting begins, and by 8:30 the votes are tallied.<br /><br />For more serious issues or the annual club elections, we have the nominations, they get input, and the club membership has the month to vote.<br /><br />The 1+ mechanism is for issues such as the bylaw changes, where we need to vote twice, with one month between votes.<br /><br />In the next meeting there will be some very contentious issues discussed, and I am NOT comfortable anymore with just the guys who show up for the meetings as the sole deciders. I think its time we make our club more accessible to EVERYONE who is a member of the FF. OF course, to do this, we have to vote to do it, and do it twice, as this is a bylaw change, but I strongly suggest we come up with a better way of bringing democracy to the Fellow Feathers.</div>
