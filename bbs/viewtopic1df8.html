<br />Coast Guard Rescues Man from Cliff
<br />U.S. Coast Guard | May 15, 2006
<br />Alameda, CA. - The U.S. Coast Guard rescued a man from the side of Muscle Rock last night while assisting the Daly City Fire Department with their initial efforts to hoist the man to safety.
<br />
<br />At approximately 8:40 p.m. the Coast Guard received a request for assistance in rescuing a hang glider who had crashed into the side of the cliff north of Pacifica. Air Station San Francisco launched an HH65 helicopter which arrived on scene at 9:15 p.m.
<br />
<br />The helicopter crew assisted by lighting the area around the stranded man while members of the Daly City Fire Department attempted to lower themselves to the victim. When the fire department could not reach the hang glider, the Coast Guard crew lowered a rescue swimmer onto the cliff.
<br />
<br />The man was hoisted from the cliff and transferred to an Emergency Medical Team waiting nearby, and was in good condition.</div>
