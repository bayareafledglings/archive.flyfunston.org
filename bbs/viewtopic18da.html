<br />
<br />Two views I would find helpful but was unable to complete with the last rev of the webcam setup were from the observation deck directly towards Westlake and directly towards Mt. Tam.  They'd be fun and, potentially, informative.  
<br />
<br />We have wi-fi in the clubhouse and could rig a Yagi antenna.  Would you recommend that or a cell modem?  We're already paying a fixed monthly cost - it'd be a shame to waste it.  On the other hand, getting wi-fi that distance, through the fog, to a station on a wind-facing tower would have its challenges.  It might be easier if we had a more rigid, truly vertical, windsock pole.  
<br />
<br />You can talk with the current executives about any friends and family discounts.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.html" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />

				<div class="content">A couple more thoughts:
<br />
<br />- The resolution on these cameras isn't fantastic - maybe .38 megapixels, if I'm reading it right.  We need better resolution than that for our purpose.  The cam in the clubhouse is 7MP. Do they have a higher res version?
<br />
<br />- I have to say, the IQEye cam we have in the Ropes building (the view of the setup area only) has been totally headache free.  It's not as good a resolution as the one in the clubhouse, but it's pretty reasonable (1024x768, maybe?) an it being in a harder-to-reach spot means uptime is crucial.  We don't want to have to go out there once a month or so just to reset the thing.  In the two years it's been in, it hasn't gone down once.  BTW, it was graciously donated, completely gratis, by a pilot down in SoCal.  What a guy!

				<div class="content">Hi Frontman, you could donate the set up to FF and get an ad on right side of the home page? You could get above MSC. Just a thought.</div>
