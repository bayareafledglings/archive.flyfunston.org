<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">October 11 &amp; 12, 2008</span>
<br />
<br />Announcement
<br />
<br />Do you need some thermals and good HG pilot company? Early October is normally great flying at Lake McClure!
<br />
<br />It will be that time soon at the Mother Lode Sky Rider’s annual Octoberfest Hang Gliding event.
<br />
<br />As always, visiting pilots are most welcome at the “Fest”. The popular Speed Gliding event will be held both days at 9 am. Will Eric F. break the 1 minute barrier again? The cross country competition and spot landing contest begin around noon depending on conditions. Or participate in the event by flying for fun. 
<br />
<br />A mere $30 donation will allow entry to the competition, food and drinks, and provide MLSR with important fundraising for the club. 
<br />
<br />Directions: Take State Highway 132 east towards Coulterville. Go about 1/2 mile past the turnoff to Horseshoe Bend Recreation Area and look for the Landing Zone gate to your right. If you end up in Historic Coulterville, do not despair. Buy beer and drive back down to the west a couple miles and look for the LZ near the lake. If you drive by the gate on your way back and end up at Don Pedro Market, do not despair. Buy more beer, turn around and head back to McClure. The gate to the LZ should be accessible for the weekend. Pilots normally meet in the LZ, load up onto a 4WD and head to the locked launch gate. Please don’t hesitate to ask others (at the LZ) if you need a ride to launch or offer a ride if you have the room.

<br />Other Notables:
<br />
<br />Coulterville:
<br />
<br />The nearby town of Coulterville has a good restaurant and bar near the historic Hotel Jeffery. There should be rooms still available for these dates so visit their site or give them a call at 209-878-3471.

<br />
<br />Camping: 
<br />
<br />There will no doubt be outbreaks of pilot camping complete with TIWTIWGTD stories around the camp fire this year at the Horseshoe Bend Campgrounds...
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.lakemcclure.com/camping/horseshoe_bend.html" class="postlink">Click here for Horseshoe Campground Information</a>
<br />
<br />Some love the “no lights” camping areas of Horseshoe Bend Recreation Area Campground which have the feel of being in a remote area. 
<br />
<br />The nearest gas stations are Don Pedro Market and the one near the other side of Don Pedro.
<br />
<br />T-shirts (including those donated by Chris Valley) will be available for $20. 
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">See you at Lake McClure on October 11 &amp;12!</span></div>
