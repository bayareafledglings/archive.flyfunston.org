				<div class="content">Hey James, haven't seen you in a while, hopefully we'll cross paths when you're back.<br /><br />That's awesome that you're self-policing, wish we had more pilots like you.<br /><br />I contacted the club president about an incident, and he wouldn't tell me who the pilot was that pulled this maneuver:<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://youtu.be/4gT6OYLaNMI?t=6m43s">https://youtu.be/4gT6OYLaNMI?t=6m43s</a><!-- m --><br /> <br /> Then he sent me this reply????<br />&quot;I heard he got hit with someone's wake I think he's just inexperienced and doesn't know what's going on and he's trying to blame other people for his ignorance.&quot;<br /><br />Then I found out who it was and got a reply from the president that the pilot's really sorry and  didn't mean to do it???<br /><br />Rule #5:<br />5. Pilots must fly safely and courteously, clearing all turns and maneuvers and observing International Ridge<br />Soaring Rules. Harassment, intimidation, or any conduct that could reasonably be expected to create conflicts with<br />other pilots, flying related or otherwise, are prohibited at Fort Funston and club events.</div>
