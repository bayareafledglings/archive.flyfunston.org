				<div class="content">Due to the tremendous amount of feedback the USHGA BOD and EC received from the CCS and members regarding the upcoming power vote, the EC has decided to withdraw the vote and re-think the process of a new vote.  Attached are some announcements from Lisa Tate (USHGA president) and Peter Birren (CCS).

<br />Subject: EC Decision on Powered Harness Initiative 
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />Dear Fellow Directors, 
<br /> 
<br />Due to recent developments with the powered harness vote, the EC has voted 
<br />to adopt the following course of action: 
<br /> 
<br />The EC has voted to alter the course the membership vote on the powered 
<br />harness initiative as it currently stands. We will still be going to a 
<br />membership vote, but only after the BOD itself has reached a resolution and 
<br />voted on this issue. Proceeding with a membership vote on an issue the BOD 
<br />has not taken a clear, consolidated stand on is backwards. As the Board, 
<br />organizational governance is our job. WE need to ensure effective 
<br />organizational planning, and to determine and monitor the organization's 
<br />programs and services. 
<br /> 
<br />Directors should act as supporters and builders of an organization, while 
<br />also playing the role of questioners and monitors of the organization. Also 
<br />in our governing role the board 
<br />must stand outside of the organization and hold it accountable to the 
<br />members. 
<br /> 
<br />The EC has adopted the following, and Peter Birren, (along with the rest of 
<br />the CCS) have agreed to withdraw their petition for yet another special 
<br />membership meeting / vote, in favor and support of this proposal: 
<br /> 
<br />The EC will immediately appoint a Task Force as described below. I am 
<br />planning on appointing thingy Heckman as facilitator, with the following 
<br />individuals: Bill Bolosky, Davis Straub, Mark Forbes, Tad Hurst, Roy 
<br />Mahoney and Peter Birren. 
<br /> 
<br />NOW THROUGH MARCH 1: The task force will meet and develop up to 3 
<br />comprehensive, factual, proposals for the BOD to vote on in COS. It would 
<br />be great if the Task Force could develop one unified proposal, but I doubt 
<br />that will occur which is why I suggest limiting proposals to three. I 
<br />personally would see these three proposals as 1.) no power; 2.) All powered 
<br />harnesses; 3.) Limited powered harnesses. Each proposal will need to 
<br />identify realistic pros and cons, possible consequences, and 
<br />budgetary/financial implications for the Association. 
<br /> 
<br />EARLY MARCH: The final proposals should be in the hands of the BOD no later 
<br />than March 1. There will also be time available at the BOD meeting for a 
<br />brief presentation (15 to 20 minutes each) for all 3 proposals 
<br /> 
<br />FRIDAY, MARCH 17: BOD would vote on powered harness initiatives during old 
<br />business in general session. The winning proposal will be the action of the 
<br />BOD and will be presented to the membership for validation. The General 
<br />Membership meeting and vote on change of Association's name in the Article 
<br />of Incorporation will still occur as planned. 
<br /> 
<br />SOMETIME BEFORE THE OCTOBER BOD MEETING: Special Membership meeting to vote 
<br />on BOD resolution from March 17 meeting. This (will) be preceded by the 
<br />Notice to the Membership and the dissemination of the Proxies, etc. 
<br /> 
<br />The ramifications of our decisions in this matter will forever impact our 
<br />organization. We need to work together to resolve this volatile issue in 
<br />the best interests of our sports. 
<br />

<br />President, USHGA

<br />Subject: New developments 
<br /> 
<br />Hi, guys. 
<br /> 
<br />The present change-the-AOI vote is OFF THE TABLE! 
<br /> 
<br />We on the CCS and you have worked hard to push the issue of no motors in 
<br />USHGA. Apparently our concerns have been heard which resulted in Lisa Tate 
<br />taking a strong, creative leadership position and making an offer we 
<br />couldn't refuse (it made _that_ much sense). 
<br /> 
<br />I see this as a terrific opportunity to finally and fully answer all the 
<br />questions and confront the problems we certainly saw with the all-motors 
<br />proposition. There will be no hiding from, twisting the truth or outright 
<br />lying because everything will be in the open - exactly how is not set up yet 
<br />but will be soon. 
<br /> 
<br />Read the following and let me know if you agree or disagree, or if you have 
<br />anything to add. 
<br /> 
<br />I hope you join in a round of applause for Lisa and support her idea. 
<br /> 
<br />- Peter

<br />Subject: The Petition and The Plan   
<br /> 
<br />I would like to personally (as much as these forums allow) thank everyone 
<br />who signed and sent in a NO MOTORS petition form. Your help in this matter 
<br />has in no small part caused the situation to change drastically. All sides 
<br />and potential outcomes will now be aired in full, both good and bad. There 
<br />will be no ignoring anything, least of all your signatures. 
<br /> 
<br />So continue to send them in as instructed at 
<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.poteau.com/petition.htm">http://www.poteau.com/petition.htm</a><!-- m --> to register your opinion for no motors. 
<br /> 
<br />The CCS (The Coalition for Common Sense, or Helping Save USHGA from Itself) 
<br />has agreed to withhold the petition from going to a specific vote but the 
<br />petitions may still help later on by showing the board your opinion. 
<br /> 
<br />Thank you for helping. We will now fully cooperate and participate with the 
<br />new Task Force and work toward a better outcome for the future of the org. 
<br /> 
<br />- Peter 
<br /> 
<br />PS: please keep 'em coming... and keep the faith!</div>
