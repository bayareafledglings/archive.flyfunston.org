				<h3>February 3, 2021 Fellow Feathers' Meeting Minutes</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Thu Feb 04, 2021 9:19 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>RonB</strong></div>
				<div class="content"><ul><li> Jessica Koerner (President)</li><li> George Artz (Tech Officer)</li><li> Brad Martin (Safety Director)</li><li> Chris Valley (Vice President)</li><li> Ron Barry (Secretary, Training Bowl Admin)</li><li> Steve Rodrigues (Treasurer, GGNRA Liason, USHPA Safety Coordinator)</li><li> Rob Racer (Clubhouse Manager)</li><li> John Simpson</li><li> Isaiah Clapp</li></ul><br />It's not a shear. It's a convergence. <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://soaringcafe.com/2012/07/weather-to-fly-convergence-along-a-sea-breeze-front/">http://soaringcafe.com/2012/07/weather- ... eze-front/</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Misc.<br /><ul><li> Opened with some stories about the last couple days of flying.</li><li> John Simpson will be giving free tandem intros to HG to all comers. None of<br />    these passengers will be his existing students. There is no implied or<br />    explicit assumption that these passengers will become students, and this<br />    will be made clear to them.</li><li> John will be flying an H2 student (not one of John's historical students)<br />    to get him his tenth hour.</li><li> It was suggested that we bar non-members from even setting up a glider. Idea<br />    was it would give us a more clear-cut line of delineation (sp?) when we have<br />    any of a number of unwelcome pilots around. The usual behavior is that they<br />    set up and, if there's no objection, they fly. (e.g. the powered<br />    paraglider.) Better to have law enforcement show up and be able to bust them<br />    without being able to fall back on the defense that they didn't intend to<br />    fly. The consensus was that we're in good shape with things where we are and<br />    no vote was held.</li><li> Informationally, there's a proposal to develop the property of the stables<br />    and two of their neighboring properties: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://thorntonbeachbluffpreserve.com/about-thornton-beach-bluff-preserve/">http://thorntonbeachbluffpreserve.com/a ... -preserve/</a><!-- m --></li><li> John suggests flying at Poplar Ave, in Half Moon Bay. There's a parking lot<br />    there by the beach. It's unregulated. </li></ul><br />President<br /><ul><li> Chapter renewal is complete. Included recommendation to update site intro<br />    page. Steve has made some changes to make it easier to find the intro from<br />    the site guide page.</li><li> Majo's dad is down with Covid, so the aerotow clinic has been delayed. Join<br />    WhatsApp group for updates.</li><li> There's a random Amazon App using the Fellow Feathers name to advertize his<br />    videos. We've asked him to remove our name and any reference to footage he<br />    has no permission to use.</li><li> Has sent letters to everyone that made high-value donations.</li></ul><br />Vice President<br /><ul><li> Only about 12 sticker applications have come in so far. Chris asks that we<br />    communicate via Social Media to encourage people te get their stickers before<br />    they fly. Best bet is by mail, everyone.</li><li></li></ul><br />Treasurer<br /><ul><li> Confirmed receipt of sticker applications and payment from Chris.</li><li> $19,337.51 minus 12k roofing fund: $7,337.51.</li><li> All bills are paid.</li></ul><br />GGNRA Liason<br /><ul><li> RRRG have recommended that our chapter be approved for continued insurance<br />    coverage.</li><li> Updated James w/ info on Rob's work on &quot;The Doghouse&quot;, that we've replaced<br />    the door and have plans for the electrical work. (James is the guy at GGNRA<br />    that we generally work with.)</li></ul><br />Clubhouse<br /><ul><li> Lots of work (LOTS AND LOTS OF WORK) have been done in the clubhouse. Lights,<br />    lockers, door, electric, exterior lights, etc. Moving the lockers has given<br />    us room for more racks, which Rob has already installed, adding 12 slots.</li><li> Rob has put out a notice that anyone who wants a second slot, has the chance<br />    to do that again.</li><li> We've lost 5 people from the clubhouse, this year.</li><li> Checked for rats/mice. No sign of them. Rebaited all traps.</li></ul><br />Tandem Administrator (absent)<br /><ul><li></li></ul><br />Tech Officer<br /><ul><li> flyfunston.org will be migrated from webfaction to ts(missed the audio). We<br />    will be notified a couple weeks in advance.</li><li> We recently got a new weather station. The one next to the clubhouse is from<br />    davis instruments. We have a new Tempest from WeatherFlow. Rob mounted the<br />    Tempest on the pole next to the Davis. Rob is currently looking at the quality<br />    of the data and we'll choose if/when to switch after that evaluation.</li></ul><br />Safety Director<br /><ul><li> Brad will be keeping a journal of accidents and will be submitting a<br />    complete list to USHPA on a regular basis. (Cadence to be determined.) If<br />    you are involved in - or witness to - an accident, it is your responsibility<br />    to notify Brad. Preference is that all pilots report their own accidents.</li><li> Soham had a blown launch in late January.</li><li> If there's an incident that falls under the RRG's reporting rules, the pilot<br />    MUST report it to Brad. Extra witness reports are helpful to provide further<br />    data. This all helps us to get our insurance costs down. See RRG's<br />    information in USHPA mag about why more reports actually reduce our costs.<br />    (USHPA actually prefers that every witness to an accident reprort it to<br />    them.)</li></ul><br />Training Bowl<br /><ul><li> John Simpson was flying (Feb 2) on the lower cliffs. Someone from the horse<br />    stable (on a horse) was screaming at him to leave the area (while John was<br />    in the air.) Our SUP does give the horses priority, so please give them as<br />    much room as possible.</li></ul></div>
