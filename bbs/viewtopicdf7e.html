				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Tue May 08, 2012 10:44 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Attendees:  Steve R, Larry C, Raffy, Tim W, Tracey S, Walter W, Diver Dave, Jim W (visiting from Oregon), Chuck K, Jose P, Michael J, Chester B, Tom R, Jim M, Damien D, Ray S, Chas N, David R.<br /><br />Club Business:<br />-Anemometer fixed, spare one being built by Chuck.<br />-Clubhouse - New plywood sheeting needed across bottom of the clubhouse. <br /><br />Safety Officer<br />-Pete resigned as safety officer.  Steve Rodriguez nominated and voted in as the new safety officer.<br />-The two main safety issues discussed at the May club meeting were observing the 25' rule and taking care of parked gliders so they don't pose a danger to any person and/or property.<br /><br />Parking gliders: Keep an eye out for changing wind direction and velocity. Remember that your glider might have been sheltered by a glider that has since moved! Take the incentive to re-park any glider you see that is in danger of blowing over and keep them tucked against the bush.  All club members are authorized and encouraged to move gliders if they may pose a danger.  Pilots are reminded that their gliders may be moved by other pilots to keep everyone safe.<br /><br />25' Rule (25' bubble): No flying/landing within 25' of any person on the ground, pilots included (dogs excluded).  The 25' starts from the closest part of the wing to any person on the ground.  This rule will be strictly enforced.  Spectators and pedestrians are our biggest risk and MUST be avoided. There is now a row of orange cones 25' back from the sand trail to form a safety buffer zone.  Pilots are encouraged to lower a leg when they are deciding to land to warn pilots on the ground to nicely ask pedestrians to wait before proceeding across the sand trail. If there are people on the sand trail you MUST land outside the buffer zone or risk suspension.  Do not fly over pedestrians lower than 25' (bubble).  This is crucial and people will be watching! If there are no breaks in pedestrian traffic or if you are getting too low to top land safely, keep flying or go to the beach. If a pilot lands on the beach, show your support of their wise and responsible decision by helping them carry their gear back up!  Pilots may suspend themselves for 24 hours or any officer may suspend any pilot for 1 week per club rules.<br /><br />-The safety officer will contact instructors to discuss Hang 2 flights and rules.</div>
