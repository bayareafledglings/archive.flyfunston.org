From this Ross devised the famous &quot;ham cram&quot; (rapid scanning of questions and answers for just a few hours, then  sitting down and taking the test).  His method has consistently achieved pass rates of 75-95% and higher.<br />This method does NOT teach you how to be a radio operator, or even the material which underlies the test questions. This method focuses on your PASSING the test. This is Step 1 in becoming a ham radio operator.<br />Step 2 is to learn how to use a radio. We sell an inexpensive book to help with Step 2 right after the exam.  Step 3 is to buy a radio, and Step 4 is to get on the air, and get experience checking into nets that are used for preparedness and drill. As you progress in Step 4, you may wish to serve as net control for a net some evening.<br /><br />But first things first--get your license. And that is what this day's activities are all about.  Because the test focuses on SHORT TERM memory, there is little purpose in getting the technician test materials in advance.<br /><br />Study tips: If you want to do some advance preparation, get hold of a high-school physics book and read the part about the relationship between wavelength and frequency and the relationship between current, voltage, resistance and power.<br />  Or:     Wavelength x Frequency = Velocity<br />Or read the first four pages of<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_2/1.html">http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/vol_1/chpt_2/1.html</a><!-- m --><br />For radio waves, we use the velocity of light, 300 million meters per second. If we measure frequency in Megahertz (1 million cycles per second), then the formula becomes meters x megahertz= 300. So if I ask you what is the wave-length of a 150 Megahertz signal, the answer is 2m. If you need to convert meters to feet, multiply by 3 and add 10%. A half-wave antenna has one-half wavelength elements. A conventional dipole has two 1/4 wavelength elements.<br />Current (rate of flow) = amperes (amps) =       I<br />Voltage (pressure) = volts = EMF =              E (for electromotive force)<br />Resistance = ohms =                             R       I=E/R<br />Power = watts                                   P       P=I x E</div>
