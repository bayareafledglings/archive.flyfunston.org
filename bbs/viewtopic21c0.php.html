				<h3>2017 GGNRA Special Use Permit and the “Rule of Six”</h3>

				<div class="content">.<br />Good news, after two years of review and negotiation, the GGNRA issued us a new Special Use Permit!<br /><br />This permit took time to negotiate due to past issues between hang glider and paraglider pilots, and some longer past issues involving FF members and law enforcement. These issues were eventually resolved but the GGNRA has remained skeptical of our status as a Park Partner to the point that they reduced the term of our permit from 5 years down to 12 months, and then would do so only on the condition that FF and BAPA work together to create rules that would insure a long term solution.<br /><br />Being in a similar position with their permit, BAPA was happy to work with us in convincing the GGNRA that we can all get along. A critical element in this effort was our co-authoring a short set of agreements that got coined the “Rule of Six” (because there are six main rules).<br /><br />This “Rule of Six” has been added to both FF and BAPA Special Use Permits and our compliance is required if we expect to keep our flying sites open.<br /><br />There is no mechanism to force SUP compliance by unregulated pilots flying from the Dumps, but thankfully the great majority of those pilots see the advantage of cooperation and mutual respect, and not just because it will make flying more safe and fun for everyone, but also because it will keep from drawing the attention of certain governing agencies who might perceive a need to regulate the Dumps.<br /><br />It is my belief that if the Fellow Feathers can stay off the GGNRA’s radar this coming year, then they will extend the term of our next permit to 2 year and eventually 5!<br /><br />Let’s all have fun together and fly safe, thanks in advance for everyone’s cooperation!<br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />Mutual agreements between the Fellow Feathers and BAPA, the “Rule of Six”.<br />1.	All pilots shall observe International Ridge Soaring Rules.<br />2.	All pilots shall use caution and courtesy when flying near other aircraft:<br />-------a.	Pilots shall not pass upwind of another aircraft in such a way that would intentionally and dangerously wake the other aircraft.<br />-------b.	Pilots shall respect a minimum safe distance from other aircraft of 25’ in all directions, unless prior mutual consent is obtained.<br />3.	No pilot shall linger upwind or in front of any launch site in such a way that would prevent another pilot from launching safely.<br />4.	No pilot shall linger upwind or in front of any landing zone or landing window in such a way that would prevent another pilot from landing safely.<br />5.	No pilot shall enter an established soaring pattern if their joining that pattern would create a safety hazard or cause another pilot to take evasive action to      remain in that pattern.<br />6.	No pilot shall deliberately intimidate another pilot by flying in an aggressive or threatening manner.<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</div>

				<div class="content">The two primary guys were BAPA President Dave McMillan and then FF President Dr. Ken Martin. Not only were they attentive to the SUP language but they also had a huge influence in getting the Dumps pilots onboard, which was key in maintaining the status quo of the Stables permit. Huge thanks to both!</div>
