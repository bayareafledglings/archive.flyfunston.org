				<div class="content">Van  P  and I  did a  Wallaby  tag  team.  Neither of us got  much air time.  I  flew the  Ranch   Feb  25 ..and  got an extended   sledder,  breaking a  weak  link at  2100  .   One pm  conditions  were  soarable  but  turbulent  on tow.  My  arms  were  completely  tired out due to the  heavy  bar  pressure  towing a   rental Sport  2   from  the  carabiner.  should  have   pulled  on more   VG   .   oh well ,    it  was  fun.  took a   ground   school  from  Mike  Barber on March  8 ...he  counseled  me  not to fly the   windy  conditions  that  day.  Then  Van  arrived March  9 and the  wind  was  gusting to  25.. unflyable  and a  windy  forecast  all  this  week.  Van  is  waiting  patiently   and  hopefully it  will back  off  for  some  fabulous   Spring  Wallaby  jumping jack  action.<br />go   Van  ,   rack the Ranch   <img src="images/smilies/icon_razz.gif" alt=":P" title="Razz" /></div>

				<div class="content">Mr Calif Redemption Value,  Thermals  were    broken and tricky to track .thanks  for  asking.    Mike Barber  and  two others  went   XC,  while  myself  and  10 others  sank out  after 20 minutes. Mike B  said  that you  ' gain  200' , then move'      queried  'which way '    he said    'that's the  tricky  part , depends on what's  happening ,   when the lift  stops  you'd  better  know which way to head ,  could be up , down or cross wind'  <br />the tow was  as  rough  as Calif,  ..not a typical day  . the  tow pilot said it was the 3rd  roughest  day  he'd ever seen  at  Wallaby. I  broke a  weak link at  2000', was going for 3K .  should  have pointed   my  nose at the  tug's  right  wing tip as he  entered the  turn ,  but I  went  too wide and snapped it .<br />  I only tried to  fly  2 days.  I believe    Van tried  to  fly  about  6  days  , and finally  got  one  day  in, with three  tows  and  got his brew  consumption and  AT rating     .   <br />how about your  story  Van?</div>
