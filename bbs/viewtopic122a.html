				<div class="content">Hey Darrrel,
<br />Awesome shot of the GGB! I thought the Fort would be too strong and NW to be any good so I went to Mission as did many, even some Funston regulars! It was both great and weird to see them in a different setting.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.html" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />We had a good day there, wind around 12-15, light ridge lift with thermals to almost 3,800' and other areas of wide spread buoyancy. I could see the fog pushing over the top of the coastal range, looked thick over there.
<br />
<br />What were the conditions like at the Fort? Was it strictly a ridged day? Do I kick myself for missing it?!    <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.html" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /></div>

<br />
<br />It was very strong on Friday, but on Saturday it backed off a bit. I think it was do-able on a flexy, but not sure it would have been that much fun. The bumpy areas were bigger than the smooth ones. There were a couple paragliders scooting around low at the dumps (I uploaded another picture which shows them). 
<br />
<br /> If I could have stayed above 1500' at Pacifica, it would have been possible to go further south and still return.  After getting up to 2100' north of the gap, I tried going north but didn't make it much past the zoo.  So I headed back to Westlake and climbed up, but the shear began to dissipate. I fell out of it and had to take ridge lift home. Even if you're high in the Swift, it's hard to penetrate.
<br />
<br />But by then, it formed better to the north and I found myself back in business when I reached the Funston Cliff and was able to head north then.
<br />
<br />These are my favorite conditions for the Swift.
