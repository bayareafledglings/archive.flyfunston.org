<br />This is a fun social event with XC challenges (optional), prizes, and a BBQ.
<br />Come and meet the local pilots, learn more about our flying sites and experience the thrill of flying high over spectacular mountain scenery.
<br />Due to the nature of high altitude mountain flying, this is an H3/H4 only event.
<br />Please go to our website at <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nvwings.com/flyin.html">www.nvwings.com/flyin.html</a><!-- w --> to get more info.

				<div class="content">A final reminder of the Nevada Wings Fly-In, plus a bit more info.
<br />
<br />The weather gods seem to be smiling on us. The forecast is for post frontal NE winds on Saturday and East wind on Sunday. Very promising  
<br />
<br />Everyone is welcome to just fly around and enjoy the snow covered peaks, but if you'd like to challenge yourself there will be a waypoint competition with some nice prizes donated by Flytec, Wills Wing, and Moyes. Flytec have been very generous.
<br />
<br />There are 9 waypoints all within gliding distance of Washoe Valley, and 4 recommended LZ's. A complete lap of the waypoints is about 30 miles.
<br />To give everyone a chance at prizes there will be 3 categories: Expert - anyone who has flown more than 50 miles, Non-expert Topless, and non-expert Kingpost. We will also award an overall prize by applying a handicap. There are various file formats of these waypoints (including Google Earth) at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nvwings.com/flyin.html">http://www.nvwings.com/flyin.html</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />This is strictly on the honor system, GPS units are NOT required. But for those who would like to experiment with their new 6030, load the waypoints up and see where it takes you! For the non GPS inclined, take a trip around the waypoints in Google earth and try to memorize them. They are all easy to recognize and they all tend to be thermal hot spots. A couple of the waypoints are a little way back, please don't push it, this is just for fun.
<br />
<br />Prizes will also be awarded for Spot landing, highest altitude and longest duration.
<br />
<br />It looks like it should be launchable off Slide all day Saturday and Sunday, but we should try to wrap up the pilots meeting by 9:30 and head up the hill asap. It could be soarable by 11:30. Please be prompt to the pilots meeting at 8:30.
<br />
<br />Please note that there is limited parking at the Duck LZ, but the rangers have said we can park along the side of the road by the LZ. Please don't block the road. If you are camping in the state park it is probably worth returning your vehicle to your camp site and walking back to the LZ for the BBQ.
<br />
<br />As well as the BBQ, we will provide water and soft drinks in the Duck LZ, Slide LZ and at Launch.
<br />
<br />Please bring your own alcohol, preferable not to launch though!
<br />
<br />If you have any questions please post them at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.aeroforum.us/showthread.php.html?p=32572#post32572">http://www.aeroforum.us/showthread.php.html? ... #post32572</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Remember that Slide launch is at 8200'. The wire crew at launch will tell you to keep the nose down and run like f@@@. We mean it!
<br />
<br />Look forward to seeing everyone,
<br />Bruce.</div>

				<div class="content">Saturday  the  wind  was  N and gusting to  20 .  We went  up to Rainbow to H. wait.  One  local NV.  pilot launched and  plummeted. Everyone went  down to the  sports  bar at the LZ.  a   huge lawn  where we  can  land is  in the  center of the community  of Cold Springs (pop 4,000).
<br /> mebbe we ought  come  back to fly it on an  east  day.
<br /> .......  Sunday was a soarable Slide day , NE at  4  most  of the  day.
<br />  20 or so pilots  toured around the Washoe Valley dragging waypoints  behind them. There were 9 turnpoints, the two  winners  tied claiming  seven.   This pilot got low at  Mt Rose and ended up  landing in Galena in a farmer's field. Dropped a  streamer which  spooked a grey fox out of a willow thicket  . The fox ran down wind.  Landed on a slight downhill .  came right up to and startled a  barbed wire fence . Flared square into the  wind just  short of perforation..a no stepper. 
<br />never land in that field  again ,  had to  jump over  4  fences and  two  streams to get to the road. Thanks for finding me , SB ground support  specialist.
<br />Prizes were handed  out.  a Funston pilot won the hammer award.
<br />There was a  BBQ  in the LZ at Washoe  both  days.  tasty  cuisine esp chicken and suasage.
<br />thanks Mr Bruce B  for  putting on a great  comp and handing out some decent trophies.  wished the hammer had gone to  me but there was 3  inches of dirt stuck up my ..keel.
<br />anyone know who  won?</div>
