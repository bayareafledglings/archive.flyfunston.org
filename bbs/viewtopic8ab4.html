<br />
<br />Safety 
<br />• We aren’t keeping a log of the accidents out here.  We should.
<br />• Someone nearly hit the bathrooms.  Pilot was getting low on a light wind day and attempted to land north of the parking lot.  He did not have enough speed/height to come fully around and nearly hit the toilets.  
<br />
<br />Special projects
<br />- LZ warning sign beside the water fountain
<br />    o HG X-ing
<br />    o Hang Glider Landing Zone – with a picture of a person being landed on. 
<br />    o We need someone to put together this artwork – GGNRA?
<br />    o Text – Caution.  Hang glider Landing Zone
<br />    o Needs to be near the drinking fountain to avoid being another landing hazard
<br />    o One sign by the water fountain, one coming up the trail.
<br />    o Henry and Daniel to talk to Rudy Evanson (sp?).
<br />
<br />- Visitor display
<br />    o Interpretive display.
<br />    o GGNRA would take care of the display if we provided the art and story.  
<br />
<br />- Windsock pole
<br />    o Probably doesn’t need repairs
<br />
<br />- Nominal pay for someone to keep the clubhouse and area clean
<br />    o Pay someone $40 / month for the next 6 months for cleaning inside the clubhouse, launch, setup area, and nearby area.  Proposed by Daniel, seconded by Mike. All in favor. 
<br />    o Duties to be decided.
<br />
<br />- Could put weather stripping on the door.  Could cut a trench in front of the door.
<br />
<br />Graphics competition
<br />
<br />- Daniel suggested we have a competition for a new graphic to put on hats, mugs, stickers, etc.  Open to anyone’s submission.  The graphic should represent Funston in particular, not just HG.
<br />- Put up some money as an award for the chosen design?
<br />- Attila suggested the money won’t be a motivator – do it for the glory and glamor
<br />- Should it be associated with an event?
<br />
<br />Silent Airshow
<br />- Everyone should go to the silent airshow</div>
