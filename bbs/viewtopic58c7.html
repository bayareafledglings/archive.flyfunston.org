				<div class="content">Elections for the 2007 Fellow Feathers Board will take place at the Dec 12 club meeting.  The meeting will start at 7:00 pm.  Please come out to nominate and/or vote for your favorite board member, or even to offer to contribute yourself!
<br />
<br />Though most of the volunteers have graciously offered to stay on, Attila Plasch (treasurer) and I (president) have decided to step down after several years on the job. 
<br />
<br />Nominations began at the November meeting.  New nominations will be accepted at the December meeting too.  Currently standing for office are:
<br />
<br />President: Steve Rodrigues – nominated and accepted 
<br />Vice-President: Chris Valley – nominated and accepted 
<br />Treasurer – Daniel Mizyrycki – nominated and accepted 
<br />Secretary - Gwenhaël Jacq – nominated and accepted 
<br />Safety – Tom White – nominated and accepted 
<br />Clubhouse – Brian Foster – nominated and accepted

<br />
<br />Thanks, and see you at the December meeting.
