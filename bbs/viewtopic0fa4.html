				<div class="content">There was a proposal made at the May Fellow Feathers meeting to increase the annual membership fee from $20- to $30- to help cover ongoing expenses. (A pilot must be a club member to store their glider in the clubhouse.)
<br />
<br />Anyone interested in discussing the subject and participating in the vote should attend the June meeting!</div>

				<h3>Camera expenses, in particular</h3>

				<div class="content">In particular, the increase is to offset <span style="font-style: italic">some </span>of the additional costs of the new web camera system, including expected hardware wear and tear and the cost of the Internet service in the clubhouse. We can discuss it at the next meeting, but an extra $10/year seems like a small price to pay.  This amount, by the way, is to cover what the club will have to pay above and beyond the kind donations of some individuals and other flying clubs.

<br />Thanks,

				<div class="content">I thought the proposal was to increase the CLUBHOUSE fee, not the membership fee.  In other words, the cost of storing a glider would increase from $20 to $30.
<br />
<br />There currently is no &quot;membership&quot; fee required by the club.
<br />
<br />Am I mistaken?

				<h3>Clubhouse is the membership fee</h3>

				<div class="content">There is only a membership fee, not a separate clubhouse fee.  Membership in the club gives you the privilege of storing your glider in the clubhouse when there's a slot available.  But yes, the cost of storing your glider would go from $20 to $30.
<br />
<br />Membership in the club has no direct impact on your permission to fly.  Signing the waiver and making an (optional) donation to the club permits you to fly at FF (assuming the rating, USHPA membership/insurance, and other requirements are met).  Last year there were something like 200-300 pilots eligible to fly and about 100 club members.

				<h3>Increase proposed</h3>

				<div class="content">At the June FF meeting we discussed the reasons for increasing the club membership to $30- and found it financially prudent to do so. Since this issue affects many more pilots than were in attendance, we decided to give everyone a month to pass the word and mull it over. A motion was passed to raise the dues to $30-, with a final vote to be held on the July 19 meeting.</div>
