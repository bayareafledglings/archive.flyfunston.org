				<h3>No hang gliding at Fort Funston? Extreme scrutiny!</h3>

<br />
<br />I had a two hour meeting yesterday with the GGNRA to negotiate our upcoming Special Use Permit.
<br />The meeting opened with discussion about the most recent incident of disorderly conduct that involved an official police report and an open citation. There are too many details for this forum but the bottom line is that our Special Use Permit is in jeopardy.
<br />
<br />There are a number of different divisions of the GGNRA who review our permit and the Law Enforcement branch stated that if it was up to them, we would NOT get our permit renewed. There are enough other departments who want us at the Fort to override the law enforcement division at this time but our liaison made it clear that if we have another incident we WILL lose our permit.
<br />
<br />This is no joke, we MUST maintain good relations with all park visitors and rangers, and not violate any rules, especially the 25' rule, which by the way will be strictly enforced.
<br />
<br />Please, every one needs to be on their very best behavior and be a positive representative for our club and the sport of hang gliding.
<br />
<br />More details at the upcoming club meeting.</div>

				<h3>Clarification - we are under extreme scrutiny, not shut down</h3>

				<div class="content">HG pilots are not shut down from flying at Funston at this time. We are up for special use permit review, and are under the threat of losing our permit because of some pilots conduct with the public.
<br />
<br />We need to ALWAYS be on our best behavior, we must appreciate the fact that we have an absolute gem of a flying site, it is irreplaceable, and not one pilot should ever allow his ego to endanger the site for all the other pilots.
<br />
<br />Zero tolerance enforcement of the 25' rule - violate it, get suspended. No excuses.
<br />
<br />Zero tolerance enforcement of public courtesy rules.
<br />
<br />Please attend the next meeting, help to resolve this issue.
<br />
