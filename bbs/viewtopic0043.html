From this Ross devised the famous &quot;ham cram&quot; (rapid scanning of questions and answers for just a few hours, then  sitting down and taking the test).  His method has consistently achieved pass rates of 75-95% and higher.<br />This method does NOT teach you how to be a radio operator, or even the material which underlies the test questions. This method focuses on your PASSING the test. This is Step 1 in becoming a ham radio operator.</div>
