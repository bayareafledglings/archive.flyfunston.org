<br />
<br />Treasurer absent
<br />
<br />Old Business:
<br />
<br />Tandems:
<br />•Commercial tandems are not allowed at Fort Funston
<br />•Propose change to rules to either incorporate tandem rules into regular rules or to specifically allow suspension of flying privileges.
<br />
<br />Landing on Launch
<br />• Don’t pass too closely to pedestrians.  
<br />• We can suspend pilots for landing within 25 feet 
<br />• What about landing closely to other pilots?
<br />• How do we judge 25 feet?
<br />• Discussion:
<br />   o 25 feet should be up to the observers’ judgement
<br />   o Other pilots shouldn’t count
<br />   o 25 feet should be obvious, especially including the reaction of the impactee
<br />
<br />Art’s Suspension
<br />• Steve recounted the story of Art doing 2-3 loops in the launch window, in front of the deck
<br />• Art completely disregarded safety, the rules and, when confronted, any admission of his having done anything wrong.  
<br />• Steve recommends a longer suspension, no less than 30 days. Art to be informed that subsequent violation would be at least 6 months.
<br />• Let him know ahead of the next meeting. We can give him a longer suspension at the next meeting.  If he does it again we would suspend him for a year.
