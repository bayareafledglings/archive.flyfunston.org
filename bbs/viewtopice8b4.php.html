<br />(&gt;Diev,
<br />I'm the photographer from the Chronicle who was there the other day. In the original photo I turned in the caption read "Funston hanglider pilots have a safety meeting and send good thoughts to Dan." The copy editors decided to edit the safety meeting out. Sorry I wanted it in, but I only work there.
<br />I will always have fond memories of Dan.

<br />Thank you for your kind words. Dan is still on life support at SF General. With a VERY grim chance of ever living off it.
<br />I did not (mean to) mention he passed, just that Kurt (the photographer) also knew him in the past....bad wording on my part, sorry.

<br />I appologise if this has caused any additional confusion.  To say that what happened has me upset and not thinking or writing too clearly is an understatement.

				<div class="content">I find it remarkable that in an activity which brings such an overwhelming spirit of happiness and freedom can be subject to this type of tragic event.  I share the same sadness as others over the shootings of Dan and Kurt.  It is a terrible state of affairs that one has to be concerned about his or her personal safety from nuts like this shooter.  The questions flood the mind on what would motivate someone to take this course of action yet it seems to happening everywhere; it fills one with anger at such a senseless act.
<br />
<br />My families prayers are with these fellow birdmen and hope they both regain all their strength and ability to once again soar the skys above Funston.

				<div class="content">Hello all, 
<br />
<br />I've walked my dog at Funston pretty much every day for years and while I don't know any of you personally, your soaring figures are as much a part of the magic of Funston as are the gorgeous views and the very special community.  I've often wished I could get past my own fear of heights to be able to soar like that.
<br />
<br />My heart goes out to all of you in this unfathomable situation.  Should Dan pass, I hope it is some comfort to his family and friends to know that it happened at a time when he was about to do a cherished activity in a magical place.  When it's my time, I hope it comes when I'm doing something I love, not when I'm doing taxes or taking out the garbage.
<br />
<br />This forum is a wonderful tribute to both men and to all of you.  The Telluride video is incredible.

				<div class="content">Hey all,
<br />
<br />There’s been a lot of interest in getting together at Funston tomorrow afternoon in honor of Kurt and Dan.  I’d like to put some kind of time around it so Dan’s family (they’re in town now) can see the support and so the rest of the pilots have an idea of when others will be there.  
<br />
<br />How does “starting at 3 pm” sound? 
<br />
<br />Does anyone know if Kurt's family is in town?  If so, please invite them along.
<br />
<br />Personally, I think that anyone who wants to go fly in the mountains should damn well do so.  That’s as good a way of celebrating as any.

				<div class="content">Hi Everyone,
<br />
<br />My name is Jennifer and I am Dan's Niece.  I would like to know if anyone as any updated information on my uncle Dan Murphy.  My grandfather, Gerry Murphy, has flown out to be with him but I have been unable to get in contact with him.  Can someone please let me know if he is still on life support...the message board is a bit confusing...
<br />
<br />You all sound like a wonderful group of friends and it is nice to know that he is surrounded with such love and care at a time like this.  This is absolutely horrible and I wish I could be there for love and support.  I just lost my mother last year (his sister) and now this has happened.  It is beyond words.  
<br />
<br />Please give me an update if you can.  I have no other contacts with the exception of my grandfather whom I know will not be able to talk on the phone due to this.
<br />
<br />Thank you!

				<div class="content">I cannot believe this. I just found out about this. Dan was so alive, so full of good spirit and adventure. This morning I went to the hospital and I saw that the Dan I knew is gone. Only a machine still tangles a bird to this earth.
<br />
<br />He had observed me when I started flying at Funston and sponsored me to the Westlake cliffs that all newbies covet. He came across as very alert yet so relaxed and absorbed in his flying. He always had an ear open to the sky’s calling and never resisted getting up to give the wind what it wanted. “I got one more in me”, he would say.
<br />
<br />One day the weather was bad and we were huddled around the table when he got up. I told him thanks for keeping the seat warm for me. He said to watch out because it’s humid ‘cause he’d just farted on it. He was funny and nasty like that sometimes.
<br />
<br />Sure he had the ego to match and I can understand if anyone has gripes about that. It was hard for me to get any credit or brag to him about my puny achievements. He always tested the pilot in me. He did that because he had to.
<br />
<br />Seeing Dan in the sky I realized that he had perfected every aspect of his gift of flying. After thousands of hours his flying became effortless and minimalistic. Never a knot too fast, never a foot too high or an ounce too heavy. He had worked to explore every possibility and limitation of his wing. He had chased and evicted every reservation in human nature towards such a dangerous sport as hang gliding. In that sense he didn’t become fearless or brave – he became absolutely free. 
<br />
<br />Knowing all that I figured Dan’s presence in the sky was all about expressing that freedom. While I had to flap hard and stay clear, he only had to will his next adventure. His style and cool tricks were a creative display of his unity with the sky, his flying was an art in itself that I had enjoyed so much but taken for granted all this time.
<br />
<br />I left the hospital upset with Dan. Upset that he was so grand and tangible yet so fragile and fallible and cause so much pain.
<br />
<br />Thanks for everything Dan
<br />You’ll be forever in my heart</div>

				<div class="content">hello all, i found out from gordon today and just wanted to remind everybody that there will be a gathering at funston from 3p.m to sunset on saturday august 26th to remember dan...ill be coming by earlier before my gig tomorrow to pay my respect,as dan was one of the first dudes i met at funston...he was also one of the most talented,fun,intelligent,proud and funny people i met in my life..there was nothing fake about dan,which is extremly rare among a lot of people nowadays..

<br />
<br />i could go on and on about dan, much like all of us that knew him..i only knew him for about four years or so,much less than most of you guys,but it felt like i knew him much longer..he was all about having fun everyday,and trying to keep the people around him entertained..and he did just that..
<br />
<br />i am not a hanglider pilot ,just a little drummerboy and rc pilot,and though i realize ill always be a dirt monkey[rc or tandem doesnt count] i feel lucky enough to have met dan murphy,and ill honestly miss him everytime im flying my planes at the fort....thanks for the memories dan,and kurt get better soon dude..i have an xbox360 with your name on it that you can borrow for a week when your up and about...brandon</div>

				<div class="content">Dan If you can hear me, I want you to know: You have been a joy and delight to every one that has ever known you. I’ve known you since flying Soda Springs in 1974; your irreverent style has always been refreshing and funny. It’s almost impossible to be uptight when you were around. You had a way of diffusing the stresses of our other work life, outside the park and flying. I can still remember the time we went to the Los Gatos theatre and watched the three stooge’s marathon, and then the trips to Hull and Slide. Moonlight sled rides at Lexington. The alien documentary we saw about Roswell in Minden when Chuck and I got grounded from flying home that night, sleeping in the hanger getting pounded with heavy wind all night. Glider instruction in Minden, tug pilot, corporate jet pilot. The landing roost at Mission where you found &lt;safety meeting&gt; material under a rock for all of us to share, freaking amazing!! You could fly anything, you were constantly thinking, always passionate, never boring or selfish. 
<br />	Dan, most important, you will be missed as the unofficial general of the “Fun Brigade”. Someone will need to replace you, perhaps if we all contribute a little more?
<br />We will always keep you in our heart and minds. You will always be here with us, in the park, at the table, in the bush, at the cliff edge, in the air, with friends, telling stories, flying anything and everything, relaxing, being alive.
<br /> 
<br />My prayers are with you Dan.
<br />
<br />your humble friend   – Tom Jensen</div>

<br />As expected, Kurt is healing fast. They expect to transfer him to Kaiser soon, perhaps as early as Sunday. His doctor made arrangements so he could go say goodbye to Dan and Kurt walked on his own power. Good to see him upright! He will be back flying in no time.
<br />
<br />Dan will go into the O.R. around 1:00 PM this afternoon to donate his organs. His spirit was freed some time ago and now his physical remains will help others continue their quest for their own flight. Dan will live on in both body and spirit!

				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Sat Aug 26, 2006 1:38 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">As I sit here in the Florida Keys and reflect back on the Dan Murphy I knew I feel so many emotions. At first I am so angry with the world,then its is sorrow for the tragic loss of an a amazing human being. But as I think back and look over so many old pictures of Dan doing what he loved to do I can only feel joy and laugh at the memories, and happiness for being lucky to call Dan Murphy my friend.
<br />I first ran into Dan at San Jose BMW back in 1990 or so. He was working on my bike and we got to talking. Those talks continued untill today. 
<br />My friend with who I shared so many great experiences, the thrill of riding our K bikes in Death Valley at wrap speed! The first sled ride at Levin after Dan spent days and weeks teaching me to fly, I was no longer just a driver! I had a USHGA card signed off by Dan. The humbling experience of launching at Funston and yes having to carry it back up from the beach. Insted of hammering me Dan just gave me one of his catch all comments and we had a meeting. When Dan needed to log hours for his commercial ticket we flew tail dragger's in the hills above Palo Alto and went for lunch in Castroville. At Minden he showed me how to fly a sailplane, that was beyond description. We would go sailing with  Bob Vogel in the potato patch outside the Golden Gate bridge!  Will never  forget Scuba diving at Monastery Beach, or camping out at the Grand Canyon and Death Valley. To this day I know Dan had something to do with the royal straight flush I was dealt at a casino in Reno when we took the bikes for a ride on my birthday. I tell you Dan was  a man who lived live the way it was meant to be lived.  Through it all there were saftey meetings and chips ahoy! You knew when Dan was around you were always assured you would laugh so hard your sides would hurt! Dans generosity was unmatched. He never let me forget that I am living in "blue hair land". He was always telling me to get back out west, The ironic part is that when I heard about Dan I was indeed out west in New Mexico preparing for a move back out west. It is indeed true that only the good die young. 
<br />Dan , I know you are watching all this and in true Dan fashion you will have some comment that will have me rolling on the floor with laughter.
<br />I know you are in a better place and life is not fair or easy. I am one of the lucky ones who got to know you and call you my friend. 
<br />Some day we will meet again and we will laugh together again at the absurdity of it all. Untill that day my friend you will be missed.

				<div class="content">I feel it's appropriate to post to this forum at this time to convey our horror and shock at the recent events at Funston.  We've kept daily tabs on Dan's condition and Kurt's remarkable recovery.  As I type this, you're all at Funston paying a tribute to one of your own, and sending positive vibes to Kurt who (thankfully) will be joining you again one day.  Our heartfelt sympathy goes to Dan's family and to you, his friends.
<br />
<br />We met many of you this past May as we watched Chris fly for the first time.  What an extraordinary group of pilots.
<br />
<br />Take care of yourselves, of each other....and above all....keep flying.
<br />
<br />Best to all:
