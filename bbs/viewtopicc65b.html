				<div class="content">Hi all,
<br />
<br />The next FF meeting will be on Tuesday, June 10, and will be chaired by our beloved VP Chris Valley.
<br />
<br />I'll bet he would bring some cool Fellow Feathers T-shirts if anyone let him know they wanted one. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.html" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />
<br />Come help him devour the pizza!</div>

				<div class="content">Yep, t-shirts are always available to those who want one...so far quite a few have been handed out with your $20.00 donation(s) going directly to Fellow Feathers...
<br />
<br />See you all on the 15th...
<br />

				<div class="content">Can we please add the following item to the agenda:
<br />
<br />* Club Windex.  The club should start investing in a Strategic Windex Reserve to protect our members in case of rising oil prices, risks to national security, and a dirty window in front of the webcam (which someone should clean soon, thankyouverymuch).

				<div class="content">Well, the pizza was good and Dingo Dave even brought some appetizers that were pretty tasty, too...
<br />
<br />I wiped off the glass portal for the web cam, but there is an inner blotch somewhere that still shows up...you can see the Fort better regardless.
<br />
<br />Gwenhael will post the minutes...otherwise the primary discussion was whether or not to allow T1's to fly Funston.  It was decided to continue the discussion for our next meeting.  One point made was that Funston is not necessarily the place for training T1's, yet could be of benefit under the supervision of a T2 and/or T3...more later.
<br />
<br />Another topic was providing really good site introductions to new H3's flying our site.  Take the time to go over all the nuances of flying Funston.  Have the pilot shoot a few landings.  Make sure the pilot knows ridge soaring rules.  If they aren't flying well, there is nothing wrong with sending them back to their instructor for more help.
<br />
<br />Fly safe!
<br />
<br />Chris</div>
