				<div class="content">In attendance;<br /><ul><li> George Artz</li><li> John Simpson</li><li> Brad Martin</li><li> Rob Racer</li><li> Steve Rodrigues</li><li> Ron Barry</li><li> Isaiah Clapp</li><li> Javier Rios</li></ul><br />Steve (Treasurer)<br /><ul><li> Account balance: $15,459.68 minus $12k roofing: $3,459.68</li><li> Everyone except one is paid up for 2019.</li><li> Fiscal ended Sept 30. (Same as GGNRA.)</li><li> Asked George if he'd take up the position of tech officer. We're required,<br />    by the GGNRA, to have a tech officer.</li><li> All documentation required for our non-profit status have been completed and filed.</li><li> 2018 annual review completed. Review from GGNRA is very positive...<br />    commendations for the fact that what minor issues we've had have been dealt<br />    with cleanly and effectively.</li><li> Ordered stickers.</li><li> Clubhouse: power lines in the sand have been exposed&amp; buried over and over.<br />    Steve did a manual job on it a couple weeks ago. If it's still in good shape after a while, he'll<br />    do the other.</li><li> Clubhouse is full - all slots have been rented out.</li><li> Getting windtalker up and running.</li></ul><br />Rob (Prez)<br /><ul><li> Hasn't flown in a long time.... =[</li><li> has looked at end-running GGNRA to fix the toilet latches. Something like 1.2 million people come through the park every year, but the toilet maintenance is... the pits. Going down the drain.</li><li> Had a conversation w/ maintenance company (of the toilets) about getting<br />    them motivated to fix the latches. Their response was essentially that it's a major process of red tape to get them to do anything.</li></ul><br />Brad (Safety)<br /><ul><li> Abhishek's accident. Don't drift behind the ridge, people. Even when it<br />    shears and the altitude is awesome, behind the shear is just as dangerous<br />    as being behind the ridge on a strong day.</li></ul><br />John (Clubhouse)<br /><ul><li> Nothing to report.</li></ul><br />John Rinaldi (VP, not present)<br /><ul><li> New Kiddo at home. Be sure to congratulate him if you see him awake. (For the kid, not for being awake, though the latter might be appropriate as well.)</li></ul><br />George (Interim Tech Officer)<br /><ul><li> George has been working on the computers. When you save a pilot in our system,<br />    it hits ushpa.org to get their skills, data, etc. USHPA had changed the way their pages<br />    work and broke this. George has gotten that back up and running.</li><li> Need to update from 2.5 to 3.3 &amp; django, etc.</li><li> Updated the SSL cert on the website so we won't get errors accessing the DB.</li></ul></div>
