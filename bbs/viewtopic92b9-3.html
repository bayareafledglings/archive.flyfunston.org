				<div class="content">The Fellow Feathers club membership has been re-structured to allow for our customary amount of income without violating the income limits of our non-profit status. Basically, the bulk of our income must come from dues rather than donations.
<br />
<br />There have been two types of membership for many years now (Voting Members and Non-Voting Members) but now we have separate dues for each class.
<br />
<br />Voting members shall be pilots who have flown hang gliders at Fort Funston for more than 20 hours in the calendar year preceding the year in which they are entitled to vote. Voting Members may vote on club business and elections, and store their hang glider in the club house on a space available basis. The annual dues continue to be $30.00 per year as they have been for some time.
<br />
<br />Non-Voting Members are those pilots who want to fly Fort Funston and contribute to the club but don't want to vote or store their glider. Their annual dues are on a sliding scale, from $5.00 to $29.99.
<br />
<br />Our sticker applications have been revised to reflect these changes. Please note: Club membership is not required to receive a helmet sticker but your dues ARE greatly appreciated!
<br />
<br />Please email your questions to Steve Rodrigues for clarification. Thanks!</div>
