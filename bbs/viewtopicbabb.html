				<h3>Revised Bylaws</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Thu May 14, 2009 11:36 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Dan Brown</strong></div>
				<div class="content">At its 5.12.09 meeting the Club voted to accept the bylaws I proposed with the changes noted below. However since there have been changes, the bylaws cannot go into effect until they are approved by the members at two consecutive meetings. Following are the changes:	
<br />1. The fiscal year will be from October 1 to September 31;
<br />2. The President’s term is limited to three consecutive terms;
<br />
<br />The Club also asked me to clarify the notice requirement in the bylaws. The following is the clarification. If anyone has suggestions as to the language, please contact me before the next meeting:
<br />“When the proposed amendments to the bylaws are five pages or less, they shall be posted in their entirety on the Clubhouse door prior to the meetings. If the proposed amendments are more than five pages, notice that there are proposed amendments shall be posted on the door and copies of the proposed amendments shall be placed in a box next to the door and if feasible posted on the Club’s WEB site prior to the meetings.”

				<div class="content">Hi Dan,
<br />You forgot the clause about notifying members by email.
<br />I'm positive the majority of the members wanted that.
<br />
<br />I'm also pretty sure but not positive that the membership decided that proposed changes to the bylaws need NOT be taped to the door but rather placed in the announcement box.
<br />
<br />This should not be a debate between you and I but something verified by other members who were at the meeting. I request for everyone who was at the meeting to please post their understanding of the email notification question and the posting in the announcement box question, and also verify that this notice should apply to both amendments to the bylaws as well as changes in meeting date time or location.
<br />
<br />Thank you for participating!!!</div>

<br />
<br />I agree with Mr. Pifko, the address should be a member of the board. While Mark L is a fine pilot, he is not a member of the club and the use of his address is inappropriate. Please use my address, or if you have a personal problem with that, use the address of any other member of the board.</div>

				<div class="content">THESE ARE THE BYLAWS THAT WERE APPROVED SUBJECT TO MINOR MODIFICATIONS AT THE MAY 2009 MEETING. TO BECOME OFFICIAL THE BYLAWS MUST BE FULLY APPROVED AT TWO CONSECUTIVE CLUB MEETINGS. THE BYLAWS ARE THE BASIC RULES BY WHICH THE CLUB IS GOVERNED AND FLYING AT FUNSTON IS MANAGED. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT MEMBERS ATTEND THE JUNE MEETING. 
<br />
<br />PARAGRAPHS 1-5 ARE EXPLANATIONS.
<br /> 1. TECHNICAL OFFICER: The description of the Technical Officer’s responsibilities has been changed.
<br />
<br />2. MAILING ADDRESS OF THE CLUB: The address for many probably most corporations is not the address of an officer, director or member. BAPA, WOR and MCHGA don’t have addresses in their bylaws. 
<br />The most important address consideration is stability. We don’t want to be continually changing it. The Club’s legal address and its address for service of process is in the Articles of Incorporation. The address is Steve’s and it will have to be changed when he leaves office.
<br />In the Bylaws the Club’s address is Mark Lilledahl’s in Milpitas. No Funston pilot has a more stable address than Mark. He has lived in the same house for over 30 years and when he finally leaves, it will be feet first. He has spent more time at Funston than all the officers combined. 
<br />Also the mailing address is not written in stone. Unlike the other bylaw provisions, it may be changed “from one location to another” by the officers without amending the bylaws. See Article II.
<br />
<br />3. THREE YEAR TERM LIMIT: This was voted by the members at the May meeting. Three years balances experience with the need for new perspectives and the dangers of prolonged incumbency. 
<br />
<br />4. NOTIFICATION BY E-MAIL: E-mail notification places the burden on the Club to maintain an up to date list of e-mail addresses readily available to any member proposing bylaw changes. Presently there is no such list. Several members don’t have e-mail. Others may not want their addresses disclosed. Some large corporations give their shareholders the option of written or e-mail notification but this seems impractical for a club our size.
<br />
<br />5. MODIFICATIONS TO PROPOSED AMENDMENTS: Merely because the Club voted to approve the proposed amendments subject to ratification votes does not prevent members from proposing modifications. Modifications should be posted on the Clubhouse door prior to the meetings.
<br />
<br />                           BYLAWS
<br />
<br />ARTICLE I: NAME

<br />The most important address consideration is stability. 
<br />
<br />Pifko: No, this isn't the most important. It's more important that the people charged with renewing the club's insurance, renewing the permit, addressing any government paperwork, etc. get all the documents and respond in time so that we don't lose our flying privileges.  Having too many steps in the process has in the past, and will in the future, jeopardize our permit. 
<br />
<br />This is a bad idea and an underhanded way of getting back at someone who is working for the hang gliding club's welfare in good faith.

<br />Dan: 4. NOTIFICATION BY E-MAIL: E-mail notification places the burden on the Club to maintain an up to date list of e-mail addresses readily available to any member proposing bylaw changes. Presently there is no such list. Several members don’t have e-mail. Others may not want their addresses disclosed. Some large corporations give their shareholders the option of written or e-mail notification but this seems impractical for a club our size.
<br />
<br />Pifko: Aside from my completely disagreeing with you and having the ability to show you step by step how this is an incorrect conclusion, the members have voted for email notification. It's not up to you or me.</div>

				<h3>Regarding Revised bylaws</h3>

				<div class="content">Dear FF Members, During the last club meeting a vote was held to table bylaw discussions and refer to an offline comittee, the motion passed. Since that event a committee meeting happened last Sunday. This comittee was formed to work on revising the existing (simple) bylaws. The reason for changing the bylaws? Basically, the bylaws needed to be updated to mesh with the recent change to club incorporation. Also, wording was changed to be more consistant with non-profit status and adding provisions for protecting FF officers and agents etc. The reference for the changes are the existing (in force) bylaws which I believe are consistant with the wishes of the general pilot population present at the May and June meetings. 
<br />
<br />The comittee: (Steve R, Martin, Chris V, Dan Brown and Tom J)  have worked these issues and completed bylaw revisions. Dan Brown will publish them to this discussion board for review and subsequent approval.
<br /> 
<br />I hope you will support this balanced and fair approach to these changes.
<br />
<br />Best Regards</div>
