				<h3>Minutes 8 April 2008</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Wed Apr 09, 2008 8:36 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Fellow Feathers <br />8 April 2008 <br /><br />Present were: </span>
<br />
<br />&quot;railroaded&quot; and &quot;railroaders&quot;. 
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold"><br />Topics were:</span> 
<br />
<br />- Heated debate regarding suspension issued to M.L.
<br />  Sweet nothings are exchanged...
<br />
<br />- Ranger Rudy is moving away. The club thanks him for his service.
<br />
<br />- A new special use permit agreement is in force for 2 years.
<br />
<br />- Current clubhouse rules use the term &quot;Active Pilot&quot; defined as someone who flies at the Fort 3 times per year. Suggestion is made that Clubhouse rules use language from the Bylaws, with the term &quot;voting member&quot; defined as someone who has flown Fort Funston more than 20 hours proceeding the year in which they are entitled to vote.
<br />Motion is passed.
<br />
<br />- <a href="viewtopic5f0e.html?t=588" class="postlink">Auction will be held Saturday, 12 April 2008 (10 am to 5 pm).</a>
<br />
<br />- Training bowl should be groomed. Chris V. is to buy shovels.
<br />
<br />- New &quot;cone head&quot; warning signs are noticed and well liked by the public.
<br />
<br />- Chris V. had &quot;Fort Funston&quot; t-shirts made. Get your own for $20.
<br />
<br />- New budget presented by Daniel M. Budget is passed.
<br />
<br />- There was an accident on Sunday, 6 April 2008. Pilot Charles F., new H3, crashed on landing, after missing his turns on less-than-ideal conditions. He was wearing a DOT-approved motorcycle helmet which might have prevented serious brain trauma as he impacted the keel with force.
<br />
<br />&gt; In case of evidence of forceful impact, encourage the victim to stay still (without forcing them, which would lead to further injuries). Place victim on backboard.
<br />&gt; When in doubt, land at the beach.
<br />
<br />- Westlake Director position is discussed. Gordon will submit new ideas for revisions.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">No more tar, no more feathers. Meeting is adjourned.</span></div>
