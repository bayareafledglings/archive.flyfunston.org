				<div class="content">I havent been around funston for long but from what I hear the cliff used to be in much better condition than what its in now?  From talking to a few people they say a couple sand slides have disrupted the flow of air coming up the hill making launch a real pain in the ass at times..... <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.html" alt=":(" title="Sad" /> 
<br />
<br />My question is why not fix it?  I have done some erosion control on the santa cruz coast to fix improper drainage that led to sand slides and I think the same fix would apply and make the face of the hill coming up to launch nice and smooth. 
<br />
<br />The idea is to take a 30'x100' net  ( nylon strap 1" wide 2" squares) and drape it right over the edge, staked at the top, pulled tight to the desired angle and staked at the bottom & sides, then it gets filled up with the existing sand.......   there is some work involved and a little bit of money but I dont see any problem as to why it wouldnt work.....
<br />
<br />How about we put our heads together and nip this in the butt?  I will dedicate any amount of time to make the launch a safer (and easier) place to jump....

				<div class="content">there  has been a lot of smoothing of the cliff after dave's take off.  there still is a big  rotor generator on the edge of the new slide that comes over the launch.  if ya look over the edge and find knob and move your launch to one side or the other it would take care of most of these problems.</div>
