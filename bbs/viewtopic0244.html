				<div class="content">We are putting together an instructional video describing launching and landing techniques at Funston.  If you have any video and can describe the wind conditions at the time, please post here and let us know.
<br />
<br />The idea is to have a DVD we can give to new-to-Funston pilots.

				<h3>Funston Video</h3>

				<div class="content">So far I have recorded a few launches and landings and a few scenes with Henry giving pointers.  The good part is that hang gliders are naturally photogenic.  The bad part is we'll have to key out the pilots' faces.  Juuuuussst kidding.  I have compiled a test clip, and well, gosh, the DVD authoring software actually works.  
<br />
<br />The video part is easy. The hard part is getting together and writing the narration/script, and then somebody with a not-too-wimpy recordable voice (that leaves me out) will need to be miked so we can tape the film script.  As for music, I have royalty-free stuff, which admittedly sucks.  Any suggeestion for a background score(s) would be great.
<br />
<br />This thing won't happen overnight, but the more energy in, the better the final product. 
<br />
<br />As for a new name for our Association, I have no ideas, but I would suggest, FIRST come up with the mnemonic, THEN figure out a name.  And just when I was getting comfortable with OooshGah, they want to change that name too.  Sheesh!</div>
