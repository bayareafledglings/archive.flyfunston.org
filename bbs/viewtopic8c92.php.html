				<h3>Proposed Bylaws change</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Fri Apr 17, 2009 4:26 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">To all voting members;
<br />The Fellow Feathers needs to adopt new bylaws specifically designed for a non-profit corporation. An attorney who specializes in non-profit law has provided a set of standard corporate bylaws for our use. All important clauses from our old bylaws have been written into the new bylaws. The club will be voting to accept the new bylaws at the May and June 2009 club meetings.
<br />Any member may request a copy of the proposed bylaws by contacting the club president.</div>

				<div class="author">by <strong>Dan Brown</strong></div>
				<div class="content">The proposed revised bylaws should be rejected. I believe so stronlgy in this that I posted the below in a separate thread titled &quot;Save Fellow Feathers&quot;. Upon request I will make Word or PDF copies of the bylaws available. According to our current bylaws, copies of the propsed bylaws should be posted on the Club house door. 
<br />
<br />&quot;Revised bylaws have been proposed for the Club. They should be rejected. The bylaws will change Fellow Feathers from a group of pilots who like to fly and want to keep Funston a hang gliding site into a USHPA like organization run by a few with an indifferent or hostile membership. 
<br />
<br />The proposed bylaws are irrelevant to our needs or requirements more applicable to the Sierra Club or R.E.I. In the context of a hang gliding club, they are confusing, complicated, undemocratic and while overlong incomplete. I doubt if those promoting the bylaws read and understand them. 
<br />
<br />	The Club’s current bylaws are four pages written in plain English. The revised bylaws are 32 pages written in legalistic jargon. The revision gives control of the Club to “directors”. Presently, however, the Club has no “directors”. It has officers. UHSPA like directors would have to be elected. 
<br />
<br />	Following are some of the objectionable provisions of the revised bylaws. “Sec.” refers to the section of the revised bylaws.
<br />	1. Directors decide who joins the Club. Sec. 3.12. 
<br />2. Members may vote only on: 1. Election of directors;2. Disposition of all or substantially all of the Clubs’ assets;3. Mergers;4. Dissolution.  Sec. 3.2   
<br />	3. Members cannot set dues and fees. Directors set dues and fees. Sec. 3.4
<br />	4. Directors may terminate a pilot’s membership in the Club without a
<br />               hearing and without the pilot being able to confront his accuser
<br />   or have witnesses testify in his behalf. The directors only have to
<br />        	   give notice to the pilot that his membership will be terminated. The member’s
<br />   “opportunity to be heard” may be limited to submitting a written statement. Sec.	
<br />   3.8(b).
<br />5. Club meetings may be held at any place directors want “within or without the
<br />    State of California.” Sec. 4.1
<br />6. With certain limited exceptions, notice of Club meetings must be given “either
<br />personally or by first class, registered, or certified mail or by other means of     written communication, charges prepaid” to each member 10 days before a meeting. Sec. 4.4(b)
<br />7. Voting by mail is permitted. Sec. 4.9. 
<br />8. Proxy voting is permitted. Sec. 4.12.
<br />9. Directors make the “rules and regulations”. Sec. 5.1(b).
<br />10. On behalf of the Club, directors may “borrow money and incur indebtedness.”
<br />     Sec. 5.1(c).
<br />11. Vacancies in the board may be filled “by a majority of the remaining
<br />     directors.” Sec. 5.5(d).
<br />    	12. Directors may pay themselves from the Club treasury. Sec. 5.7
<br />	13. Directors remove officers. Sec. 8.4
<br />	14. Directors change the bylaws. Sec. 10.4
<br />	15. Annual reports must be prepared. Sec. 10.9.
<br />
<br />The revision provides the discussed above procedure for suspending or revoking a pilot’s Club membership but there is no provision for suspending or revoking a pilot’s flying privileges. Evidently the author was unaware that pilots may fly at Funston without being Club members.
<br />
<br />Copies of the bylaws are available from Steve. I also have a copy and upon request will e-mail it to you.
<br />
<br />GET A COPY AND READ IT.&quot;</div>

				<div class="content">Dan,
<br />For an attorney you have a disturbing pattern of making false or inaccurate statements to support your own agenda. It seems very unethical.
<br />
<br />The bylaws do NOT require the posting of the proposed bylaws on the clubhouse as you claim. They state:
<br />
<br /> &quot;Article XI: Amendments
<br />Section 1: These bylaws may be amended by an affirmative vote of two thirds of the members present at two consecutive club meetings. Notice of the proposed amendment must be posted on the clubhouse door prior to the meetings.&quot;
<br />
<br />I have posted notice of the proposed amendment exactly as required.
<br />
<br />Dan, this is not a duel between the two of us, I'm working for the club and would appreciate some help, not someone twisting the facts and taking pot-shots at me. Stop trying to be the adversary all the time, it doesn’t help.
<br />
<br />It also doesn't help to chase redundant threads so I've locked this topic. If you want to debate this subject further let's use your post on &quot;Save Fellow Feathers&quot;, or better yet, come to the meetings and speak in real time.
<br />Thank you.
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />The text of the proposed bylaws follow and are best viewed by cut and paste into another document, like Word for instance.
<br />
<br />The following proposed bylaws have been updated to Version 4 that prohibits Directors from being paid for their services. Please feel free to email me if you would like a PDF copy.
<br />

The officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be given promptly to the members entitled to vote, under Section 4.4 of these Bylaws, stating that a meeting will be held at a specified time and date fixed by the Board; provided, however, that the meeting date shall be at least 35 but no more than 90 days after receipt of the request.  If the notice is not given within 20 days after the request is received, the person or persons requesting the meeting may give the notice.

<br />(2)	To a recipient who has provided an unrevoked consent to the use of those means of transmission for communications; and
<br />(3)	That creates a record that is capable of retention, retrieval, and review, and that may thereafter be rendered into clearly legible tangible form.
<br />(d)	Notwithstanding the foregoing:
<br />(1)	An electronic transmission by this corporation to a member is not authorized unless, in addition to satisfying the requirements of this section, the transmission satisfies the requirements applicable to consumer consent to electronic record as set forth in the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (15 United States Code section 7001(c)(1)).
<br />(2)	Notice shall not be given by electronic transmission by the corporation after either of the following:  (i) the corporation is unable to deliver two consecutive notices to the member by that means or (ii) the inability so to deliver the notices to the member becomes known to the Secretary, and Assistant Secretary, or any other person responsible for the giving of the notice.
<br />(e)	An affidavit of the mailing of any notice of any members’ meeting, or of the giving of such notice by other means, may be executed by the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or any transfer agent of the corporation, and if so executed, shall be filed and maintained in the corporation’s minute book.
<br />Section 4.5	Quorum.  Five percent (5%) of the voting power shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of members.  If, however, the attendance at any general or annual meeting, whether in person or by proxy, is less than one-third of the voting power, the members may vote only on matters as to which notice of their general nature was given under Section 4.4 of these Bylaws.  Except as otherwise required by law, the Articles, or these Bylaws, the members present at a duly called or held meeting at which a quorum is present may continue to transact business until adjournment, even if enough members have withdrawn to leave less than a quorum, if any action taken (other than adjournment) is approved by at least a majority of the members required to constitute a quorum.
<br />Section 4.6	Voting.  Subject to the California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law, members in good standing on the record date as determined under Section 4.10 of these Bylaws shall be entitled to vote at any meeting of members.
<br />(a)	Voting may be by voice or by ballot, except that any election of directors must be by ballot if demanded before the voting begins by any member at the meeting.
<br />(b)	Each member entitled to vote may cast one vote on each matter submitted to a vote of the members.
<br />(c)	.If a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power represented at the meeting, entitled to vote and voting on any matter, shall be deemed the act of the members unless the vote of a greater number, or voting by classes, is required by the California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law or by the Articles.
<br />Section 4.7	Waiver of Notice.  The transactions of any meetings of members, however called or notice and wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after standard call and notice, if (a) a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and (b) either before or after the meeting, each member entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice, a consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes of the meeting.  The waiver of notice, consent, or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of the meeting except that, if action is taken or proposed to be taken for approval of any matter specified in Section 4.4(a) of these Bylaws, the waiver of notice, consent, or approval, shall state the general nature of the proposal.  All such waivers, consents, or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
<br />A member’s attendance at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting unless the member objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.  Also, attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
<br />Section 4.8	Actions By Unanimous Written Consent.  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the members may be taken without a meeting, if all members consent in writing to the action.  The written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the meeting.  The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the members. 
<br />Section 4.9	Actions By Written Ballot.  Any action, except the election of directors, that members may take at any meeting of members may also be taken without a meeting by complying with the following provisions:
<br />(a)	This corporation shall distribute one written ballot to each member entitled to vote on the matter.  The ballot and any related material may be sent by electronic transmission that meets the requirements of Section 4.4(c) of these Bylaws.  All solicitations of votes by written ballot shall (a) state the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirement; (b) state, with respect to ballots other than for election of directors, the percentage of approvals necessary to pass the measure or measures; and (c) specify the time by which the ballot must be received in order to be counted.  Each ballot so distributed shall (a) set forth the proposed action; (b) give the members an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval of each proposal; and (c) provide a reasonable time in which to return the ballot to the corporation.  If the corporation has 100 or more members, any written ballot distributed to ten or more members shall provide that, subject to reasonable specified conditions, if the person solicited specifies a choice in any such matter, the vote shall be cast according to that specification.
<br />(b)	 Approval by written ballot shall be valid only when (i) the number of votes cast by ballot (including ballots that are marked “withhold” or otherwise indicate that authority to vote is withheld) within the time specified equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and (ii) the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required for approval at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by written ballot without a meeting.
<br />(c)	A written ballot may not be revoked.
<br />(d)	All written ballots shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation and maintained in the corporate records for at least three years.
<br />Section 4.10	Record Date for Notice, Voting, Written Ballots, and Other Board Actions.  For purposes of establishing the members entitled to receive notice of any meeting, entitled to vote at any meeting, entitled to vote by written ballot, or entitled to exercise any rights in any lawful action, the Board may, in advance, fix a record date.  The record date so fixed for –

<br />(b)	Voting at a meeting shall be not more than 60 days before the date of the meeting;
<br />(c)	Voting by written ballot shall be no more than 60 days before the day on which the first written ballot is mailed or solicited; and
<br />(d)	Taking any other action shall be no more than 60 days before that action.
<br />Section 4.11	Record Date for Actions Not Set By Board.  If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for determining members entitled to receive notice of a meeting of members shall be the next business day preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, the next business day preceding the day on which the meeting is held.  If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for determining members entitled to vote at the meeting shall be the day on which the meeting is held.
<br />If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for determining members entitled to vote by written ballot shall be the day on which the first written ballot is mailed or solicited.
<br />If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for determining members entitled to exercise any rights with respect to any other lawful action shall be the date on which the Board adopts the resolution relating to that action, or the 60th day before the date of that action, whichever is later.
<br />For purposes of Sections 4.10 and 4.11 of these Bylaws, a person holding a membership at the close of business on the record date shall be a member of record.

A validly executed proxy that does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and effect until either:
<br />(1)	It is revoked by the member executing it before the vote is cast under that proxy, (i) by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked, (ii) by a subsequent proxy executed by that member and presented to the meeting, or (iii) as to any meeting, by the member’s personal attendance and voting at the meeting; or

No provision made by this corporation to indemnify its or its subsidiary's directors or officers for the defense of any proceeding, whether contained in the Articles, these Bylaws, a resolution of members or directors, an agreement, or otherwise, shall be valid unless consistent with this Article IX.  Nothing contained in this Article IX shall affect any right to indemnification to which persons other than such directors and officers may be entitled by contract or otherwise.
<br />Section 9.8	Forms of Indemnification Not Permitted.  No indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article VIII, except as provided in Section 9.4 or 9.5(b) of these Bylaws, in any circumstances where it appears:
<br />(a)	That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles, these Bylaws, a resolution of the members, or an agreement in effect at the time of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or otherwise limits indemnification; or
<br />(b)	That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly imposed by a court in approving a settlement.
<br />Section 9.9	Insurance.  This corporation shall have the power to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of this corporation against any liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the agent's status as such whether or not this corporation would have the power to indemnify the agent against such liability under the provisions of this Article IX.
<br />Section 9.10	Nonapplicability to Fiduciaries of Employee Benefit Plans.  This Article IX does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment manager or other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in such person's capacity as such, even though such person may also be an agent of this corporation as defined in Section 8.1 of these Bylaws.  This corporation shall have power to indemnify such trustee, investment manager or other fiduciary to the extent permitted by subdivision (f) of Section 207 of the California General Corporation Law.

<br />ARTICLE X
<br />
<br />OTHER PROVISIONS
<br />Section 10.1	Maintenance of Corporate Records.  This corporation shall keep the following:
<br />(a)	Adequate and correct books and records of account;
<br />(b)	Minutes of the proceedings of its members, Board, and committees of the Board; and
<br />(c)	A record of each member’s name, address, and class of membership.
<br />The minutes and other books and records shall be kept either in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into clearly legible tangible form or in any combination of the two.
<br />Section 10.2	Members’ Rights of Inspection.
<br />(a)	Unless the corporation provides a reasonable alternative as provided below, any member may do either or both of the following for a purpose reasonably related to the member’s interest as a member:
<br />(1)	Inspect and copy the records containing members’ names, addresses, and voting rights during usual business hours on five days’ prior written demand on the corporation, which must state the purpose for which the inspection rights are requested; or
<br />(2)	Obtain from the Secretary, on written demand and tender of a reasonable charge, a list of names, addresses, and voting rights of members who are entitled to vote for directors as of the most recent record date for which that list has been compiled, or as of the date, after the date of demand, specified by the member.  The demand shall state the purpose for which the list is requested.  The Secretary shall make this list available to the member on or before the later of ten days after the demand is received or the date specified in the demand as the date as of which the list is to be compiled.
<br />The corporation may, within ten business days after receiving a demand under this Section, make a written offer of an alternative method of reasonable and timely achievement of the proper purpose specified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the membership list.  Any rejection of this offer must be in writing and must state the reasons the proposed alternative does not meet the proper purpose of the demand.
<br />If the corporation reasonably believes that the information will be used for a purpose other than one reasonably related to a person’s interest as a member, or if it provides a reasonable alternative under this Section, it may deny the member access to the membership list.
<br />Any inspection and copying under this Section may be made in person or by the member’s agent or attorney.  The right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts.  This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.
<br />(b)	On written demand on the corporation, any member may inspect, copy, and make extracts of the accounting books and records and the minutes of the proceedings of the members, the Board, and committees of the Board at any reasonable time for a purpose reasonably related to the member’s interest as a member.  Any such inspection and copying may be made in person or by the member’s agent or attorney.  This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.
<br />Section 10.3	Maintenance and Inspection of Articles and Bylaws.  This corporation shall keep at its principal California office the original or a copy of the Articles and Bylaws, as amended to the current date, which shall be open to inspection by the members at all reasonable times during office hours.  If the corporation has no business office in California, the Secretary shall, on the written request of any member, furnish to that member a copy of the Articles and Bylaws, as amended to the current date.
<br />Section 10.4	Amendments.
<br />(a)	Subject to the members’ rights under Article III of these Bylaws, the Board may adopt, amend, or repeal Bylaws unless doing so would:
<br />(1)	Materially and adversely affect the members’ rights as to voting, dissolution, redemption, or transfer;
<br />(2)	Increase or decrease the number of members authorized in total or for any class;
<br />(3)	Effect an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of all or part of the memberships; or
<br />(4)	Authorize a new class of membership.
<br />(b)	Once members have been admitted to the corporation, the Board may not, without the members’ approval, specify or change any Bylaw that would:
<br />(1)	Fix or change the authorized number of directors;
<br />(2)	Fix or change the minimum or maximum number of directors; or
<br />(3)	Change from a fixed number of directors to a variable number of directors or vice versa.
<br />(c)	If any provision of these Bylaws requires the vote of a larger proportion of the Board than is otherwise required by law, that provision may not be altered, amended, or repealed except by that greater vote.
<br />(d)	Without the approval of the members, the Board may not adopt, amend, or repeal any Bylaw that would:
<br />(1)	Increase or extend the terms of directors;
<br />(2)	Allow any director to hold office by designation or selection rather than by election by the members;
<br />(3)	Increase the quorum for members’ meetings;
<br />(4)	Repeal, restrict, create, expand, or otherwise change proxy rights; or
<br />(5)	Authorize cumulative voting.
<br />(e)	New Bylaws may be adopted or these Bylaws may be amended or repealed by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the members present at a duly held meeting; provided, however, that any such adoption, amendment, or repeal also requires approval by the members of a class if that action would:
<br />(1)	Materially and adversely affect the rights, privileges, preferences, restrictions, or conditions of that class as to voting, dissolution, redemption, or transfer in a manner different than the action affects another class;
<br />(2)	Materially and adversely affect that class as to voting, dissolution, redemption, or transfer by changing the rights, privileges, preferences, restrictions, or conditions of another class;
<br />(3)	Increase or decrease the number of memberships authorized for that class;
<br />(4)	Increase the number of memberships authorized for another class;
<br />(5)	Effect an exchange, reclassification, or cancellation of all or part of the memberships of that class; or
<br />(6)	Authorize a new class of memberships.
<br />Any provision of these bylaws that requires the vote of a larger proportion of the members than otherwise is required by law may not be altered, amended, or repealed except by vote of that greater number.  No amendment may extend a director’s term beyond that for which he director was elected.
<br />Section 10.5	Endorsement Of Documents; Contracts.  Subject to the provisions of applicable law, any note, mortgage, evidence of indebtedness, contract, conveyance or other instrument in writing and any assignment or endorsement thereof executed or entered into between this corporation and any other person, when signed by (a) the Chairman of the Board; (b) the President; or (c) any Vice President and the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary, the Treasurer or any Assistant Financial Officer of this corporation shall be valid and binding on this corporation in the absence of actual knowledge on the part of the other person that the signing officers had no authority to execute the same.  Any such instruments may be signed by any other person or persons and in such manner as from time to time shall be determined by the Board, and, unless so authorized by the Board, no officer, agent or employee shall have any power or authority to bind this corporation by any contract or engagement or to pledge its credit or to render it liable for any purpose or amount.
<br />Section 10.6	Representation Of Shares Of Other Corporations.  The President or any other officer or officers authorized by the Board or the President are each authorized to vote, represent and exercise on behalf of this corporation all rights incident to any and all shares of any other corporation or corporations standing in the name of this corporation.  The authority herein granted may be exercised either by any such officer in person or by any other person authorized so to do by proxy or power of attorney duly executed by said officer.
<br />Section 10.7	Contracts with Directors.  No director of this corporation nor any other corporation, firm, association or other entity in which one or more of this corporation’s directors are directors or have a material financial interest, shall be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract or transaction with this corporation, unless (a) the material facts regarding that director’s financial interest in such contract or transaction or regarding such common directorship, officership or financial interest are fully disclosed or known to the members and such contract or transaction is approved by the members in good faith, with any membership owned by any interested director not being entitled to vote thereon; or (b) the material facts regarding that director’s financial interest in such contract or transaction or regarding such common directorship, officership or financial interest are fully disclosed in good faith and are noted in the minutes, or are known to all members of the Board prior to the Board’s consideration of such contract or transaction, and such contract or transaction is authorized in good faith by a majority of the Board by a vote sufficient for that purpose without counting the vote of the interested director.
<br />Section 10.8	Loans to Directors and Officers.  This corporation shall not lend any money or property to or guarantee the obligation of any director or officer of the corporation or of its parent, affiliate, or subsidiary unless (a) the Board decides that the loan or guaranty may reasonably be expected to benefit the corporation, and (b) before consummating the transaction or any part of it, the loan or guaranty is approved by either the members, without counting the vote of the director or officer, if a member, or the vote of a majority of the directors then in office, without counting the vote of the director who is to receive the loan or guaranty.  [This corporation shall not lend any money or property to or guarantee the obligation of any director or officer.]  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of his or her duties if that director or officer, in the absence of such advance, would be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses by the corporation.
<br />Section 10.9	Annual Report.  The Board shall cause an annual report to be prepared within 120 days after the end of this corporation's fiscal year.

The annual report shall contain the following information, in appropriate detail, for the fiscal year:
<br />(a)	A balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal year, an income statement, and a statement of cash flows for the fiscal year, accompanied by an independent accountants’ report or, if none, by the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that they were prepared without audit from the corporation’s books and records;
<br />(b)	A statement of the place where the names and addresses of current members are located; and.
<br />(c)	Any information required by Section 10.10 of these Bylaws.
<br />This Section shall not apply if the corporation receives less than $10,000 in gross revenues or receipts during the fiscal year.
<br />Section 10.10	  Annual Statement of Certain Transactions and Indemnifications.  As part of the annual report to all members, or as a separate document if no annual report is issued, this corporation shall annually prepare and mail, deliver, or send by electronic transmission to its members and furnish to each director a statement of any transaction or indemnification of the following kind within 120 days after the end of this corporation's fiscal year:
<br />(a)	Unless approved the members under Corporations Code section 7233(a), any transaction (i) in which this corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary was a party, (ii) in which an &quot;interested person&quot; had a direct or indirect material financial interest and (iii) which involved more than $50,000, or was one of several transactions with the same interested person involving, in the aggregate, more than $50,000.  The statement shall include a brief description of the transaction, the names of interested persons involved, their relationship to this corporation, the nature of their interest in the transaction and, where practicable, the amount of that interest, provided that if the transaction was with a partnership in which the interested person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated.
<br />For purpose of this Section 10.10(a), an &quot;interested person&quot; is either of the following:  (i) any director or officer of this corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary (but mere common directorship shall not be considered such an interest); or (ii) any holder of more than 10 percent of the voting power of this corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary.
<br />(b)	A brief description of the amounts and circumstances of any loans, guaranties, indemnifications, or advances aggregating more than $10,000 paid during the fiscal year to any officer or director of the Corporation under Article X of these Bylaws, unless the loan, guaranty, indemnification, or advance has already been approved by the members under Corporations Code section 5034, or the loan or guaranty is not subject to Corporations Code section 7235(a).
<br />Section 10.11	  Construction And Definitions.  Unless the context otherwise requires, the general provisions, rules of construction and definitions contained in the General Provisions of the California Nonprofit Corporation Law and in the California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation Law shall govern the construction of these Bylaws.
