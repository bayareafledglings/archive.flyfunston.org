				<div class="content">I was in there last week during the rain and it was dry. I didn't check closely but was doing some glider work in there for a while. <br /><br />What time will you be there tomorrow? The floor was dirty as hell. Is mopping a good idea, or will it mop away the anti water stuff?<br /><br />Diver Dave</div>

				<div class="content">its  great to know that the  Clubhouse's leaks  may be  fixed.    thanks to Rob.  <br />seems like  this winter  wasn't much of a test compared to last  year.<br />and last year it seemed  there  was  very little  water  intrusion.<br />  dry  gliders  fly  best  by  govt test.</div>

				<div class="content">I was inside the Clubhouse today. (4/13/12) There was water on the floor inside the north roll-up door. <img src="images/smilies/icon_sad.html" alt=":-(" title="Sad" /><br /><br />&quot;Someone&quot; will need to apply a liberal dose of caulking to the outside.<br /><br />Maybe we should top it off with a wedge shaped layer of cement to drain the water away from the building and protect the caulking from the elements?!</div>

				<div class="content">if  caulking is not  designed to be  exposed  in a  wide strip ......say , wider than  an inch ,  <br /><br />then  why not  use  something  that is  designed  to be in full  sun ,<br /><br />such as ,<br /><br />the  white  'flat  roof' roofing   goop .  <br /><br />the trouble   with a  wedge  shaped  concrete  strip , is , it's   brittle  and   won't adhere  to the  existing  concrete  slab ,  and  the  narrow  edge  will  crack off if anyone steps  on it  after  a  few  weeks.<br /><br />i've been  trying  to  formulate a  fix  for  those  doors  for  years .   one guy  suggested,    make a 1 inch deep   saw  cut about  8  inches away  from the  door ,   then  use  aluminum flashing  ,  put  caulk  in the  sawcut ,  push the  flashing  edge in , then  bend it  up to the  door,  creating the  wedge  shape.<br />how to  attach to the  door?   not  sure.  this  is  what  stopped  me ,  we'd  need  a  waterproof and  12 foot  long  seal  between the  door and the  metal  strip.<br /><br />i think a  slot  drain  would be  best.<br /><br />mr  wizard ( Rob)  ,please  help ,   tooter  turtle</div>

				<div class="content">I 've never done  roofing ,  what  if it's like  rocket  science.   so let's   get a  bucket  of  roof  repair  goop and  start  spreading.  if   anyone on this  board  have any experience roofing  flat  roofs, please  post and give  us some  pointers.  I'd  rather not  get my   foot stuck in the bucket ,  with  no one around to laugh.</div>

				<div class="content">I used to have a home with a tar and gravel roof. I would spread wet patch material with a big putty knife. The trick will be to clean the surface of dirt and sand before applying.<br />Stepped in the bucket once or twice, need supervision.</div>

				<div class="content">OK Steve  name a date and  time  and I'll meet you out  there .   a  soft  broom  and a  hard  broom  might help  to unsand  that  damsel.  <br /> maybe a leaf  blower would be  better than  brooms,  to  clean  the  tiny  cracks,  and  dry the  concrete .     i don't  have one , but     we could rent     . <br />if the  area  is damp and the  roofing  stuff    won't  stick , we'll be marooned  on  Planet Goo  without an escape pod. <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.html" alt=":-D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

				<div class="content">i sopped up about two gallons of water that was in a puddle along the mural wall. i'm not sure if this water comes from the big missile door , or under the pilot entry door.  there was a puddle near the latter door  too.  the only fix is a towel placed along the bottom of the man door before the storm, or for side wire to sleep with his back against it. <img src="images/smilies/icon_mrgreen.gif" alt=":mrgreen:" title="Mr. Green" /></div>

				<div class="content">The small door needs a threshold and drip molding to keep water from blowing under it. Rob Johnson's trench drain helps some, but the door needs a well thought out major overhaul. I don't think we want to attempt something like this between storms do we? Maybe we should attack this in the spring?</div>
