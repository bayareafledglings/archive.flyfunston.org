<br />•	Tandem Proposal
<br />o	One modification: the Funston Tandem Director must meet all the qualifications to be a Funston Tandem Instructor.
<br />o	(dp: I realized afterwards that we’ve made several changes to the Rules, so I’d like to get the final version passed at the next meeting)
<br />o	Rudy Evenson, the GGNRA Head of Special Permits, came by to ask us several questions, including:
<br />&#61607;	Which of the people in the room are qualified to take people tandem? (Gordon Pollock, Eric Mies, Steve Rodrigues)
<br />&#61607;	Which pilots plan to get  their Tandem Instructor rating?  (Urs Kellenberger, Tom White)
<br />&#61607;	Rudy asked to review the safety plans and was satisfied that we are being conscientious and safe
<br />&#61607;	Who takes people up commercially, and what are their plans for Funston?
<br />•	Though there were a few people in the room who have taken people up commercially, Funston will be strictly non-commercial.  Even the solo pilots, who are willing to allow tandems to expose more non-pilots to flying, don’t want commercial activity as it will interfere with their individual flying.
<br />•	There is no way for us to monitor the non-monetary payments to pilots who take up their (potential) girlfriends
<br />&#61607;	Eric, Gordon and Steve all offered to take Rudy up for a tandem flight
<br />&#61607;	Gordon and Eric mentioned having taken up disabled people.  Rudy would like to investigate this further, as the GGNRA is making accessibility a priority for 2006
<br />o	After the whole discussion, Rudy said he was satisfied with the answers and will recommend to the Superintendent that tandems be allowed. He will write the changes into the Use Permit for 2006.
<br />o	He would prefer that we get the Use Permit documentation into him ASAP since this is the low season for permit applications. Daniel to check into getting the insurance earlier this year.</div>
