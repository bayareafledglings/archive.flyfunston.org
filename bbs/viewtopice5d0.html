				<div class="content">Present;<br /><ul><li> Rob Racer</li><li> Brad Martin</li><li> John Rinaldi</li><li> Ron Barry</li><li> Mike Shields (New H3)</li><li> Todd Bricker (New H3)</li></ul><br />Air Races<br /><ul><li> August 31</li><li> Spot landing contest?</li></ul><br />Rob (Prez Report)<br /><ul><li> Reminder: we need to inspect fire extinguishers. (John's realm.)</li></ul><br />John Rinaldi<br /><ul><li> A film crew in SF want some HG pilots at FF to be available to<br />  fly for them. Tentatively, they'll be doing Monday, 7/8 and Friday,<br />  7/12.</li><li> Opened discussion of whether we should be encouraging people to<br />  use the paypal account to send in sticker/clubhouse payments.<br />  Handling cash is a pain in the ass. Treasurer: do we get a deal<br />  from paypal, being a non-profit? Todd Bricker looked it up - the<br />  overhead from PP is 2.2%. It might still be worth it.</li></ul><br />John Simpson (Clubhous Manager.)<br /><ul><li> There had been a puddle in the blue rack row a few weeks ago. It<br />  wasn't there long, and we weren't able to determine the source.<br />  If you're on the inside of a rack, please check to be sure that the<br />  glider you're displacing isn't going to be in a bad spot when you<br />  put it on the floor.</li></ul><br />Brad Martin (Safety Officer)<br /><ul><li> Happy to see people deciding not to fly, even up to the moment when<br />  they're ready to launch.</li><li> We discussed, for the new H3s, some options on the landing<br />  approach, when to make which decisions.</li></ul><br />Steve Rodrigues (Treasurer, absent. Submitted by email.)<br /><ul><li> ...while expenses are known, our income is only an estimate based upon<br />  actual income from the previous year. Also note that our estimated<br />  income includes $506- from holding the Air Races and BBQ event, which<br />  has yet to be planned.</li><li> ...budget reflects two adjustments: First is the added expense of<br />  replacing our self-propelled lawn mower every two years. Total cost is<br />  $340-, half of which adds $170- to our annual budget. Second is the<br />  $300- annual savings in DSL service by switching from Coastside to<br />  AT&amp;T.</li><li> Our current balance at Bank of America is $19,245.86.</li><li> Our roofing fund set-aside is $12,000- which results in liquid cash<br />  assets of $7,245.80. Our budgeted expenditures total $8822.79, which<br />  means we are $1,576.93 short of balancing our budget. I am a little<br />  concerned with this shortfall because most sticker donations have<br />  usually come in by this point in the season.</li><li> One major contributing factor is that 10 clubhouse members have not<br />  paid their dues. This creates a shortfall of $750. I've contacted most<br />  of them, 4 said they would mail their dues ASAP but have yet to do so.</li></ul></div>
