				<div class="content">September 8, 2009 Meeting Fellow Feathers
<br />
<br />Present: Steve Rodrigues, Dirk Morris, Darrel Robbins, Daniel Pifko, John DeAguiar, Ted Lipke, Rob Johnson, Rafael Lavin, Dave Royer, Larry Carpenter, Damien Dykman, Tom White.
<br />
<br />Formal FF BOD Meeting was held; Motions made regarding membership and dues, to wit;
<br />
<br />1) The BOD stipulates that The Fellow Feathers of Fort Funston Hang Gliding Club shall have fixed annual dues of $30 for a voting member and sliding scale annual dues of $5.00 to $29.99 for a nonvoting member.  Nonmembers may of course also fly at Fort Funston subject to certain requirements set forth in other documents and applicable to all hang glider pilots regardless of membership status.
<br />
<br />2 ) The Board recognizes that The Fellow Feathers of Fort Funston Hang Gliding Club has always intended to be a social club and has inadvertently mischaracterized past payments as donations rather than as membership dues. The BOD moves to re-characterize all payments made from 6/18/2007  to 6/9/2009 that were in the amounts between $5.00 and $29.99 as membership dues and make nonvoting membership retroactive for all those who made such payments.
<br />
<br />
<br /> Motions seconded, voted and passed with 3 votes for, 0 votes against. BOD Meeting adjourned.
<br />
<br />Monthly FF meeting began;
<br />Steve reported on special use permit negotiations with GGNRA officials, some of the proposed changes; 
<br />new permit will be for 5 year duration, change in fee structure, BBQ and Air Races will be included, newly implemented GGNRA Service District Charges will be paid for clubhouse @ $2.58/ sq. ft., will phase in incrementally over 4 years.
<br />In lieu of use permit fee, the club will be authorized to make capital improvements and maintenance to park assets.
<br />Club will be required to obtain insurance for the clubhouse building, Steve to work on it.
<br />
<br />Incoming GGNRA General Superintendent will go more “by the book” than Brian O’Neill, FF needs to have ducks in row and cause no more trouble.
<br />
<br />Impact of recent 25 foot rule violation, conflict with spectator and subsequent law enforcement investigation was discussed. GGNRA added law enforcement paragraph to Special Use Permit. Safety action plan was shared. Severity of damage to club’s credibility / reputation with GGNRA was discussed. The need to educate all pilots who fly at Funston as to the importance of mitigation / prevention / cooperation / diplomacy, remains a pressing issue. 
<br />Motion was made to add wording to FF rules to comply with use permit:
<br />“3. Pilots shall comply with the laws and regulations under surveillance and enforcement by the GGNRA / NPS which include cooperation with rangers and law enforcement officers.”
<br />Motion was seconded, vote taken; 8 votes for, 1 opposed, 1 abstention.
<br />
<br />Recent dog attack on flying pilot which resulted in crash with injuries was discussed. The need to report all such incidences was emphasized.
<br />
<br />John DeAguiar from USHPA and Sonoma Wings reported on his ongoing efforts to re open Lawson’s Landing/Dillon Beach to H.G., also asked for input regarding his liaison position with USHPA. A number of members offered their help as needed with the Dillon beach project, and some ideas regarding USHPA were put forth; discomfort with secret meetings and votes, desire for tech support re: wind talker equipment.
<br />John also invited all pilots to Sonoma Wings Hull Mt Fly In, September 20th, bring radios.
<br />
<br />Clubhouse weather proofing / maintenance was discussed, possible addition of de-humidifier equipment. Resolved to proceed with weatherization first, then see how humidity levels are affected prior to installation of de-humidifier equipment.
<br />
<br />D. Pifko reported on tech equipment issues, 2 day down time was result of tampering with AC outlets dedicated to computers, need to isolate power supply from public, add power strip for RC guys.
<br />
<br />GGNRA approved language for dog signs, Steve will make and install signs.
<br />
<br />Kiosk @ set up area is in need of repair, Tom White to work on it.
<br />
<br />Meeting adjourned</div>
