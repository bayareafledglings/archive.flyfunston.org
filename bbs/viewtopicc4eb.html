				<div class="content">This coming Tuesday's club meeting (10/8) is vitally important. Our special use permit and site insurance are seriously at risk and we will be discussing those concerns. <br /><br />USHPA's President, Rich Hass, will be attending our meeting to address concerns that have put our site insurance at risk. Mitch Shipley, USHPA's appointed Investigative Officer for the upcoming hearings will attend our meeting as well. <br /><br />We will also vote in a new VP. Patrick has served our club well this year, but due to extensive travel requirements that have been implemented in his job, he no longer has the time necessary to serve as VP and has stepped down. Thank you for having been there for our club, Patrick! You'll be missed. <br /><br />The location of Tuesday's meeting is to be determined. We are in the process of arranging an alternative place to meet should the government shutdown still be in effect at that time. We'll announce the location once we've firmed it up. The meeting, as usual, will be from 7:30pm to 9pm.</div>

				<div class="content">I want to thank the many folks who made the trek to Pacifica last night. The meeting was a great success and the overwhelming majority sent out a clear message.<br /><br />The club put some stronger rules in place and the FF EC is committed to a zero-tolerance policy. I believe that the clubs actions will put to rest USHPA's insurance concerns and the concerns of the NPS/GGNRA.<br /><br />In addition, two long-time Funston pilots will be the focus of a USHPA disciplinary hearing at the BOD meeting this week.<br /><br />Things are changing at the Fort and I feel it is safe to say that the quality of life at Funston will be very much better next year!<br /><br />Again, Thank you all for helping save the site!</div>

				<div class="content">that meeting was something to remember. I'm glad i went . We are an interesting group. then  we fly sometimes  .<br />Steve Morris made a statement that resonated with the meeting. ' something like <br />'what are you willing to give up to continue flying at funston'<br />it's a unique site that needs more attention than the other sites. <br />would the BLM ask us to do dirt road repair to fly Hull Mtn?  or ,would the Nevada DOT ask us to pick up roadside trash to fly at Slide ?<br />sure.  they wouldn't mind if we did help out.<br />same with GGNRA, sometimes they 'd like some help to keep the place shiny and clean, and they need more hep than the country sites because it 's the big city and gets a lot of use . except for now of course</div>
