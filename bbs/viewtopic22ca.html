I've flown there a few times and always enjoyed it.<br /><br />Second, I want to apologize if my posts have seemed &quot;off topic&quot; with my references to USHPA, Torrey Pines, and the US Hawks. I've been contacted by members of your club with an interest in these topics, and that's why I've been posting here. I hope that hasn't caused a problem, and I particularly hope that the motion to limit the discussion board to voting members was not prompted by my own posts. Please let me know if it was.<br /><br />Finally, please let me know what it takes to become a voting member of your club. I have flown at Funston several times, and I have contributed by purchasing &quot;stickers&quot; as needed. I was never sure if that made me a &quot;member&quot; or a &quot;voting member&quot; or just a visiting pilot. Any clarification with regard to the newly passed rule would be appreciated.<br /><br />Thanks in advance,<br />Bob Kuczewski</div>
