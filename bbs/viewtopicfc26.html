<br />From Martin Palmaz, USHGA Business Manager
<br />Date: March 2, 2006
<br />Calling all Chapters, Schools, Dealers and Sponsors!
<br />OUR QUEST FOR 2007 CALENDAR PHOTOS HAS BEGUN! 
<br />We're looking for a few good photos for next year's calendar
<br /> 
<br />Please send us your best-composed, most colorful horizontal-format 35mm slides or digital photos as candidates for the 2007 calendar project.  Take advantage of winter’s down time and dig out those outstanding photos that you’ve been wanting to show off. Since our calendars are printed large format at high resolution, we prefer slides for the best reproduction possible, however digital submissions are accepted as well.
<br />
<br />I have received requests for sponsorship information from those interested in promoting their local chapter, school or dealer.  If your photo is selected for one of our calendars, then you will also be contacted about potentially sponsoring the month that your photos will be published in.  Sponsorship is available to all interested parties and is not contingent on photo submissions.
<br />
<br />PHOTO SUBMISSION GUIDELINES
<br />
<br />Horizontal photos in print, slide or digital format with a MINIMUM of 3900 W x 3000 H pixels (11.7 mega pixels), although highest resolution possible is preferred. 
<br />
<br />Photos less than 3900 x 3000 will be considered but original pixel dimensions must not be less than 3120 W x 2400 H (7.5 mega pixels). Do not resize photo. Submit unaltered.
<br />
<br />INCLUDE: 
<br />* photographer’s name
<br />* mailing address
<br />* phone
<br />* email address 
<br />AND
<br />* a photo caption, location, site name, pilot name, wing type
<br />
<br />Please submit digital photos on CD or DVD if possible, but FTP is also available. Email <!-- e --><a href="mailto:martin@ushga.org">martin@ushga.org</a><!-- e --> for FTP uploading directions.
<br />
<br />Submissions deadline is May 31. Send your photos to: 
<br />
<br />USHGA Calendar
<br />Attn: Martin Palmaz
<br />PO Box 1330
<br />Colorado Springs CO 
<br />80901-1330. 
<br />
<br />All contributors will receive confirmation of receipt and photos will be returned upon completion of the project. 
<br />
<br />CALENDAR SPONSORSHIP
<br />
<br />We are currently accepting sponsorship for the 2007 Hang Gliding Calendar, and the 2007 Paragliding Calendar.  There will be two open spaces per page available for sponsorship (see attached PDF for location). One will be a 1"x3" horizontal area in the upper left hand corner of the calendar grid, where USHGA contact information currently resides. The other position available will be a screened-back logo area in the middle of the grid.
<br />
<br />Just think, this sponsorship placement will be seen EVERY DAY for a whole month!  Each position for sponsorship, 24 altogether per calendar, will cost $250 each, or $400 per page for the Hang Gliding Calendar, and $150 each or $250 per page for the Paragliding Calendar.  If you are interested in sponsoring both spots on 1 page in both calendars, then it will cost $600.  In all fairness, this will be open on a first-come-first-serve basis. Prepayment will be required by May 20th. Priority will be given to those who choose both positions on a single page. Advertisers will not be mixed on a page. Example: if you choose the upper left sponsorship only, then the USHGA logo will be appearing in the calendar grid, and vice versa. 
<br />
<br />Those who are interested, must a sign a contract and submit their artwork via 300 dpi tiff, PDF or jpeg. The artwork should be sent full size, 1”x3" for the upper left ad, and 5"x 5" logo area. We will take care of screening your logo for you. Files that are too big will be posted to the USHGA drop box (more on that later).
<br />
<br />CALENDAR DEADLINES
<br />• June 5th: Confirmation of participation, first come, first served
<br />• June 9th: Contract signed, submitted, and payment received (invoicing is not available).
<br />• June 12th: Actual artwork due.
<br />
<br />The sponsorship is completely independent from the photo selection process. While we will do our best to match photos with sponsorships, this can not be promised as it depends on the feedback &amp; participation level.
<br />As always, you may contact me via <!-- e --><a href="mailto:martin@ushga.org">martin@ushga.org</a><!-- e --> or 1-800-616-6888 with any questions you might have. I'm excited about this upcoming set of 2007 Calendars &amp; hope you take advantage of our limited spaces available. We will have a 3000 print run of the 2007 Hang Gliding Calendar and a 1500 print run of the 2007 Paragliding Calendar at a minimum, although we may consider printing more.
