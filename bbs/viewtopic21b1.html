				<div class="content">Some folks donâ€™t realize that there is a difference between just having a helmet sticker and being an actual member of the Fellow Feathers. Please allow me to clarify!
<br />
<br />The Fort Funston helmet sticker is only an indicator that the pilot has signed the waivers required to fly at Fort Funston. Having a sticker does not make a person a member of the club; it just makes them legal to fly.
<br />Sticker donations are optional but greatly appreciated!
<br />
<br />Becoming a member of the Fellow Feathers Hang Gliding Club is accomplished by filling out a Membership Application and paying the $30.00 annual fee; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../flyfunston.org/documents/membershipapp.html">http://flyfunston.org/documents/membershipapp.pdf</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Membership is required to store gliders in the clubhouse, and the annual fees are essential for the Fellow Feathers to cover expenses. Details of membership categories and benefits can be found in our Bylaws at; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../flyfunston.org/bylaws.html">http://flyfunston.org/bylaws.php.html</a><!-- m -->.
<br />
<br />Everyone is encouraged to become a member!
<br />
<br />If you have any questions, please contact prez@flyfunstondotorg
<br />
<br />Cheers!
<br />Steve R.</div>

				<h3>New type of membership</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Sat Jul 18, 2009 12:58 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">The Fellow Feathers club membership has been re-structured to allow for our customary amount of income without violating the income limits of our non-profit status. Basically, the bulk of our income must come from dues rather than donations.
<br />
<br />There have been two types of membership for many years now (Voting Members and Non-Voting Members) but now we have separate dues for each class.
<br />
<br />Voting members shall be pilots who have flown hang gliders at Fort Funston for more than 20 hours in the calendar year preceding the year in which they are entitled to vote. Voting Members may vote on club business and elections, and store their hang glider in the club house on a space available basis. The annual dues continue to be $30.00 per year as they have been for some time.
<br />
<br />Non-Voting Members are those pilots who want to fly Fort Funston and contribute to the club but don't want to vote or store their glider. Their annual dues are on a sliding scale, from $5.00 to $29.99.
<br />
<br />Our sticker applications have been revised to reflect these changes. Please note: Club membership is not required to receive a helmet sticker but your dues ARE greatly appreciated!
<br />
<br />Please email your questions to Steve Rodrigues for clarification. Thanks!</div>
