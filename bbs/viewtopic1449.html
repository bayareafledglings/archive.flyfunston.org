				<h3>New Policy for New H3 Pilots</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Tue Apr 09, 2013 11:02 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Pilots who have low hours or have recently obtained their H3 rating will need to complete the paperwork as normal and then perform one or more quick demo flights to the satisfaction of the member issuing the helmet sticker prior to the pilot being given the sticker and clearance to fly freely at Funston. To ensure that all pilots are given a proper site intro and/or do a demo flight as needed, first-time Funston pilots are not eligible to receive a sticker by mail.<br /><br />This policy has been instituted in response to new H3s making mistakes common to low-time pilots that can usually be corrected with a little observation and guidance by experienced Funston pilots. This policy is not intended to appear unwelcoming to new pilots. If you want to fly Funston, I would be happy to observe your demo flight(s) and clear you for flying, as would the other members on the mentor list at the link below that you can contact, most of whom have stickers available. Several other members have stickers as well, so there is usually plenty of opportunity for new pilots.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../mentors.html">http://flyfunston.org/mentors.php.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Dave<br />Safety Director</div>
