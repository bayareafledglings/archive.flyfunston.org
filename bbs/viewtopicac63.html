				<div class="content">Daniel Pifko and I met with GGNRA officials today to resolve the safety issues that were holding up our Special Use Permit.
<br />We were successful for now but our work can be undone all to easily.
<br />
<br />Please come to the next club meeting and find out what everyone will need to do to keep hang gliding at Fort Funston.

				<h3>new rule proposed</h3>

				<div class="content">Work on our new Special Use Permit was suspended after the incident on July 11. What hurt us more than violating the 25' rule was the fact that pilots in the LZ stonewalled the Park Police and refused to identify the pilot in question. This is what caused the chief of law enforcement to suggest that our permit NOT be renewed at all.
<br />
<br />Given that officers don't like filing reports or paperwork more than anyone else, chances are that if the pilot could have been found, the officer would have resolved the problem with the spectator on the spot rather than having it escalate through the filing of an official complaint, which is now on our permanent records.
<br />
<br />
<br />Just added to the meeting agenda:
<br />A proposal to modify FF rules by adding &quot;Pilots must fully cooperate with all NPS law enforcement officers, including Rangers and Park Police.&quot;</div>
