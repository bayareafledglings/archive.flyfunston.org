				<h3>ANOTHER Training bowl orientation 13 March 2010</h3>

				<div class="content">(new post for month of March so we don't get to confused) 
<br />
<br />The last orientation went well (Feb 6th) with 12 pilots attending. We all picked up LOTS OF TRASH and walked the entire training bowl. It was to sloppy to Hang Glide but we had fun. 
<br />
<br />Basically, the requirements to fly here are, Hang one (min) with turns and x-wind landings sign off (turn or die), sign liability waiver and get an orientation. I'll have another orientation session in one month on the 13th of March 10 AM rain or shine! 
<br />
<br />BTW, I'm looking for a replacement, I will be involved with a business venture that requires me to be out of the area half or more of the time for the next several years. In my view, the replacement should be a person that promotes the training area. My intention is to complete the liability waiver, rules and training site map before the new Director takes over, making the new directors job easier. Please talk to Allen or myself if you are interested and want to help the general hang gliding community. 
<br />
<br />Thanks 
<br />Tom Jensen

				<h3>Beach Landings</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Mon Mar 08, 2010 12:09 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">The beach sand has been severly eroded due to the winter storms. During high tide the available landing stots area limited. When you add in the &quot;beach people&quot; it is not a very safe situation.  
<br />
<br /> I went for a beach walk on Saturday and almost had to run up a 45 degree slope to get out of the surf. Basically the sand on the beach has been carved out from winter storms and is about 9 ft lower than normal. In other words, the training bowl is not safe at high tide this time of the year. 
<br />
<br />The orientation will be held this Saturday at 10AM rain or shine so new pilots can walk the area and return to train later when the sand has filled back in.
<br />
<br /> Regular Hang III and up pilots should watch the tide charts and avoid flying if the wind is light to avoid landing on the beach. 
<br />
<br />hope to see you Saturday March 13th 10AM sharp. We will meet at the picnic table, wear hiking boots, it may be muddy.</div>
