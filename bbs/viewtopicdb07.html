<br />Hi, guys,
<br />
<br />Thanks to all of you for giving up you Sunday to attend the photo seminar (at least it wasn't a gloriously flyable day...). I'm working with Rick the IT guy to get magazine-related material onto a page in the USHGA Web site, but until we get that finalized, here's the list of photo themes that we're proposing for the upcoming year. This list is totally fluid – if we don't have enough images to fit a theme, we pick another. If you have suggestions for other themes, please let me know and I'll add them. And of course if you have a great photo that doesn't seem to fit with any theme, send it anyway. If it's big and beautiful, we'll use it!
<br />
<br />May: beaches
<br />June: summery mts.
<br />July: flowers (andy stocker)
<br />August: desert?
<br />Sept: kids
<br />October: fall colors <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://photos.sickinger.net/20021102_woodstock">http://photos.sickinger.net/20021102_woodstock</a><!-- m -->
<br />November: famous pilots on old-time gliders/historical
<br />December: snowy, not necessarily alpine - check Sickinger high rock photos
<br />January:  alpine snowy
<br />February: misc. artwork, not photos -
<br />March: urban flying sites
<br />April: foolishness
<br />
<br />"the good, the bad and the ugly" – an assortment of launches and landings 
<br />aerobatics
<br />wing/ground handling
<br />duds/dress/outfits/fashion police
<br />transport vehicles
<br />scenic windsocks
<br />"first contact" – you and the locals after a great XC
<br />"behind the shot" – camera mounts etc.
<br />
<br />Image size requirements: We print at 300 pixels per inch, so a cover shot is 2700x3600 pixels (9x12"), a centerspread is 3600x5400 pixels (12x18"). To see how large a photo will print, divide its dimensions by 300 (900x1200 pixels prints at about 3x4").
<br />
<br />Submission info: Put your images, and a text file with caption and credit info, into a file named for you: First_Last. Upload directions are currently at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://ushga.dyndns.org/">http://ushga.dyndns.org</a><!-- m -->. USHGA's photo archivist is Thayer Hughes, <!-- e --><a href="mailto:thayer@ushga.org">thayer@ushga.org</a><!-- e --> – contact him if you have questions.
<br />
<br />I look forward to the flood of photos, both the new ones you'll be getting this season and some of your old (unpublished) favorites that you've dug up from your collections. Thanks again!
<br />
<br />C.J.</div>
