				<h3>Olympic Club Event Parking</h3>

				<div class="content">The Olympic Club has a permit to use the lot 8.18-26. The permit requires that parking attendants &quot;ensure that all parking on north and west sides of Fort Funston lot remain open and accessible for regular park visitors.&quot; Parking will not block access to the &quot;hang gliding barn&quot;.
<br />
<br />It seems unusual that a private golf club has been allowed to reserve part of a public parking lot for spectators attending its golf tournament while apparently prohibiting spectators parking on its property including its parking lot. Nevertheless the GGNRA has been an excellent landlord and a good friend of hang gliding and we should be greatful for its stewardship.

				<div class="content">it should be noted that there was a golfer dude on take off yesterday who refused to leave the take off while a pilot was getting ready to launch. when approached in a very polite manner and asked to back off the launch for just a moment...the golfer said &quot;F**K YOU..the olympic club should tell its members to respect our space. This turd was not representive of all the golfers...it just showed how ignorant these folks can be about our sport..... <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" /></div>

				<div class="content">On the other hand, I also hung out with a golfer and his kid/kid's friend the other day.  The kid was all over the flying thing, asking about the glider and flying and how old he has to be and several other questions well beyond the usual first couple.  The golfer said how much he enjoys seeing us overhead when he plays the hole just south of the bowl and how he likes to hang out there and watch us land.  For him it was all part of the experience of playing the Olympic Club.
