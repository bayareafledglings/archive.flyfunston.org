				<div class="content">Heads up: Getting the Ropes cam back online involved having a different organization take over the DSL line. The phone # will be moved to the new account holder on Sept. 1. (that is the current date of the AT&amp;T work order)<br /><br />We can expect the Ropes cam to be down for that week while the AT&amp;T business office completes their work. After that, everything should be solid and reliable, and at no charge to us!</div>

				<div class="content">Notice: Planned outage of Ropes cam. Due to ATT business procedures, the Ropes cam will be off-line probably until the end of this coming week. No other outages are expected.<br /><br />This is the final step in transferring  the Ropes building phone number and DSL ownership to another agency. This other agency is very stable and should be around for a long time, as will our Ropes cam!<br /><br />PS; This process has involved three independent agencies, ATT and the FF. Everyone has worked hard to achieve this much cooperation. Thanks to everyone involved!</div>
