				<div class="content">In my opinion the proposal on the 3.11.08 agenda to give Club officers free memberships is a bad idea and should be withdrawn. There should be no reward or incentive for serving as a Club officer other than the satisfaction of fulfilling your duty as a Funston pilot and the occasional gratitude or ingratitude of your fellow pilots. 
<br />
<br />Those uninterested in hang gliding and wanting special privileges should become USHPA directors. (uk excepted)</div>

				<div class="content">Steve did it ever occur to you that probably over 200 pilots including myself have served as Club officers w/o seeking compensation or a “gesture of gratitude”? Do you really think that we did not have “actual out of pocket expenses in cash, gas and bridge tolls, as well as lost wages … .”? You are the first to complain.  And if “that’s not the point”, why bring it up?
<br />
<br />You sound like Barry Bonds and soon will want your own rocker in the clubhouse. As Harry Truman once said: “If you can’t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.” The Club has a capable vice-president. You can end the crushing financial burden anytime you want.</div>
