				<div class="content">May 4th 2017 Fellow Feather’s Meeting Minutes<br /><br />In Attendance: Wayne Michelsen, Lisa Lesser, Steve Rodrigues, Mitch Shipley, and Rob Johnson.<br /><br />Guests / New Members: No guests or new members.<br /><br />Great Flights: Nothing significant to report - Mitch went to the beach two times returning from Westlake in northy conditions.<br /><br />President’s Report (Joey Villaflor): Not present - nothing to report.<br /><br />Vice President’s Report (Wayne Michelsen): Nothing to report.<br /><br />Secretary’s Report (Chris Valley): Not present. April meeting minutes posted.<br /><br />Treasurer’s Report (Lisa Lesser): All accounts in good order. The Club is slowly building up our reserves after our contribution to the USHPA insurance drive.<br /><br />Clubhouse Officer’s Report (Rob Johnson): In two weeks, Rob will start painting the walls.  The interior cement is efflorescing due to moisture wicking in the concrete walls.  He will use Dry-Lock epoxy paint which is specially designed for such application. Approx $200 materials.  Plan to repaint floor sometime around July.  Racks TBD in maybe 6-weeks.  Still two delinquent pilots: Ramone and Andy Whitehill.  Will take more severe action if no payment is made soon.<br /><br />Safety Officer’s Report (John Simpson): Pilots are responsible to make sure the launch area is clear and to maintain 25-foot clearance to people on the ground. All pilots need to know and adhere to ridge soaring rules.<br /><br />Tech Officer’s Report (Chuck Kranz): Not present, but emailed everything looks good and is building a back up computer for the webcams / weather server.  Chuck will use a Raspberry Pi computer that will only cost about $200.<br /><br />Administrator Reports:<br /><br />~ Tandem (Urs Kellenberger): Not present - nothing to report.<br />~ Training Bowl (John Simpson): Not present - nothing to report.<br /><br />GGNRA Liaison Report (Steve Rodrigues): Steve got Knox Box grade-5 bolts from mail order $26.  All parts are now in hand, ready for install.<br /><br />Old Business: Danny Freeman is working on an on-line renewal form and process.  Mitch Shipley started a discussion on AWCL requirements when winds are 20+mph.  The goal is to have a formal rule in place to address impending disasters.  The goal is not to impose burdensome hurdles for normal days.  Additionally, we can hold AWCL clinics to help pilots achieve the skills and knowledge.<br /><br />New Business: Rule-of-Six review.  Motion to amend Funston Site Regulations with Rule-of-Six.  Motion approved by vote.  All in favor.<br /><br />Meeting adjourned at a reasonable hour...</div>
