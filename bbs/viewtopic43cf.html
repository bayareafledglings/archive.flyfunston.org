				<div class="content">I just talked to Celia and got an update on Eric’s condition. He is coming along slowly, still can’t move his fingers but she is massaging them every time she visits and he is starting to get sensation back in them!<br />He has a trach tube with a ventilator but is breathing on his own more and more. Hopefully his diaphragm will continue to get stronger so they can wean him of the ventilator all together.<br /><br />The nurses say he is keeping a positive attitude about his situation but we all need to give him encouragement and remind him that we are pulling for him.<br />Our cards and letters really help so if you can spare a few minutes to write a card please send it to:<br /><br />Eric Mies<br />c/o VA Medical Center, ICU 3A<br />4150 Clement St.,  San Francisco, CA 94112<br /><br /><br />Those interested in helping with their financial situation can use PayPal!<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.hanggliding.org/eric.php.html">http://www.hanggliding.org/eric.php.html</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Thanks to everyone for your support. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.html" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div>

Eric is alert, talks w/o apparent difficulty, has use of his right arm but physically seems about the same. Pneumonia is a continuing problem. <br /><br />He appreciates visitors.</div>
