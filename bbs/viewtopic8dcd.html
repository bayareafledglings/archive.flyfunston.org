Jessica flew in Mexico again and brought back two puppies.<br /><br /><br /><br />President’s Report (Jessica): <br /><br />Mentioned first aid clinic this weekend, and upcoming assisted windy cliff launch clinic, and spot landing contest - all posted on Facebook. <br /><br /><br /><br />VP’s Report (Chris): <br /><br />A few more stickers issued and will mail March money to Steve.<br /><br /><br /><br />Treasurer’s Report (Steve): <br /><br />$12k roofing fund is now in interest bearing CD.

No news.<br /><br /><br /><br />New Business: <br /><br />Steve mentioned changing the rules of aerobatic language.  This has been posted on the Club’s Bulletin Board. Motioned that we change Rule #5 to “Stunt flying and aerobatics are prohibited at Fort Funston. Pilots may not perform aerobatic maneuvers anywhere in the area from the south end of the Training Bowl up to Sloat Blvd. Aerobatic maneuvers will be defined as any turn with a bank angle in excess of 60 degrees, or where the pitch attitude of the glider exceeds 30 degrees above or below horizontal.” Jessica motioned a second - the remainder in attendance voted in favor.  Note: The primary change in this rule is the parameters where aerobatic maneuvers are prohibited to better include GGNRA boundaries.<br /><br /><br /><br />Discussion was had to hire an arborist to assess the health of the bushes and trees around the setup area. It has been noted that the health of the trees has been declining over the years. CRV will look into an arborist to assist and forward contact info to Jessica.<br /><br /><br /><br />Old Business:  <br /><br />Jessica was able to get Flytec and Wills Wing give-away items for upcoming events.<br /><br /><br /><br />Meeting adjourned at 7:49 PM.</div>
