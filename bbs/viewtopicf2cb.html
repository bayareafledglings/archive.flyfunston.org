				<div class="content">Here is what I found at SF  Gate<br /><br />A man was injured in a hang gliding crash on a cliff side in San Francisco's Fort Funston this afternoon, a fire department spokeswoman said.<br /><br />A witness spotted the man go down while he was flying a hang glider at about 3:10 p.m., fire spokeswoman Mindy Talmadge said.<br /><br />Responding crews found him upside down in the glider about 70 feet down the side of a cliff a short time later. He was conscious and complaining of pain, Talmadge said.<br /><br />Paramedics were preparing to transport the victim to a hospital as of about 3:45 p.m.</div>

				<div class="content">It was 2 incidents about 2 minutes apart. The guy on the T2 tossed his laundry after getting into a spin over the water fountain, in the video interview afterwards he says something to the effect of him starting to black out...so he tossed it. The reserve opened, oscillated, collapsed &amp; reopened about 10 feet off the ground. He walked away with a broken downtube and a bruised ego. While he was still shaking it off and everyone was around him, Eric tumbled. He tossed his reserve but there wasn't enough altitude for deployment. He was alert &amp; conscious when the group got to him, including a nurse (walking on the beach) and a paramedic (the guy who tossed his laundry). After all the commotion John tossed his reserve on the ground (it needed a repack).</div>
