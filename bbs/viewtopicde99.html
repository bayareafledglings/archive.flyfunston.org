				<div class="content">I want to give a shout out and a huge “Thank you!” to both Tom Low and Tom White for their help last Sunday. I got up in the shear, flew till I was satisfied, then wanted to land before the north wind got too crazy. The trouble was that the park was pretty busy and there were very few breaks in the pedestrian traffic on the sand trail.<br /><br />Landing on the chips is often the sweetest place in the entire LZ so Tom and Tom set themselves up on either end of the sand trail, and when they saw a pilot wanting to land, would kindly ask people if they could wait a minute so a glider could come in. It worked great! I was able to do a clean approach without worry of hitting anyone (or violating the 25’ rule) and thanks to their help had a perfect landing on the chips. A great finish to a great flight!<br /><br />These two selfless guys set a prime example of how club members can really support each other. I can’t emphasize enough how much better and safer the Fort would be if more of us followed their lead.<br /><br />Thanks again, you guys are the best!!!<br /><br />Steve</div>
