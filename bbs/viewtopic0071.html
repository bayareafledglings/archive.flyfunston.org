				<div class="content">August Fellow Feathers Meeting Minutes<br /><br />In attendance:<br /><br />Ken Martin<br />George Artz<br />Jim Mueller<br />Bob Kuczewski<br />Darrel Robbins<br />Tom White<br />Charlie Nelson<br />Raffy Levin<br />Kathy Ong<br />Chuck Kranz<br />Tom Rust<br />Josh Cohn<br />Steve Rodrigues<br />Tom Low<br />Darrel Hambley<br /><br />President Tom Rust brought up for discussion Art Thompson's stalled loop which resulted in his crashing into the cliff, as well as aerobatic flight, stunt flight, or reckless flight in general at Funston. It was noted that this latest incident occurred within 5 days of Art's promise to the Club at the July meeting not to engage in this type of behavior. It was resolved that the executive committee shall schedule a disciplinary hearing for the September meeting, and that Tom Rust shall give timely notice to Art Thompson of the hearing. The membership present was unanimously in favor of serious consequences for Art this time. <br /><br />It was brought up by Steve Rodrigues that the last printing of the safety rules had accidentally omitted wording to ban aerobatics or stunt flying at Funston. After discussion, it was resolved that the aerobatics / stunt flying wording should be restored to the rules, and that the definition of the flight activities window be expanded to include &quot;out to the waterline of the ocean&quot;, or some such to include the airspace from the cliff line, out to the ocean.<br /><br />A motion to act on the above was put forth, seconded, and voted upon. 9 members voted for it, 2 opposed. <br /><br />Tom Rust brought up the Funston Air Races, scheduled for the weekend of August 25th, that there will be T shirts, and a BBQ. Volunteers are being coordinated to run the event<br /><br />Barbecue budget was discussed. Tom White asked for an accounting of Club Funds spent on the July 4 BBQ.<br /><br />Safety officer Steve Rodrigues brought up for discussion suspension policy for safety violations, requesting clarification regarding the concept of &quot;saving up&quot; multiple violations; whether an officer could impose a multi week suspension on a pilot for several different violations occurring over a period of time. The majority of the membership present was opined that no, this was not allowable within the Club's bylaws. <br /><br />Steve put forward a motion to require Tom Rust to write a letter to the U.S.H.P.A. explaining that he did not impose a 3 week suspension on Steve. Motion was seconded, 12 members voted for it, 1 opposed.<br /><br />Bob Kuczewski requested that Fellow Feathers consider becoming a member of US Hawks Hang Gliding Association. Several attendees requested that Bob return with specific proposal for HG insurance, prior to being considered. Steve R pointed out that Bob was quoting outdated rules which have since been revised. No action was taken by Club to join US Hawks at this time.<br /><br />Clubhouse Manager Charlie Nelson made it clear that emptying the garbage cans in the clubhouse is not a part of his duties.</div>
