				<h3>Tandem Hang Gliding at Fort Funston</h3>

				<div class="content">Hello everyone,
<br />We did a straw poll at a recent club meeting to see if anyone would be opposed to having a tandem hang gliding program at Fort Funston. There were no objections, so a committee was formed to develop a tandem proposal for the GGRNA. I wrote the backbone, met with Gordon Pollock and Urs Kellenberger to flesh it out, then with some fine tuning by Daniel Pifko, came up with what we feel would be a safe, and low impact way to allow tandem flying at the Fort. I have posted the proposed tandem rules below. This trial program would have to be voted in by the club membership, and could be modified down the road. Because our Special Use Permit expires at the end of February, we felt the need to send the proposal to the GGRNA right away. Their process might take some time, but we would like to get club approval ASAP, so we can start flying tandem if it comes through. Please take a few minutes to read over our proposed rules and come to the club meeting to vote on them.
<br />Thanks!
<br />Steve Rodrigues, V.P.

<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />5)      Funston Tandem Instructor approval may be rescinded by the Tandem Director or a majority of the Fellow Feathers Executive Committee at any time for unsafe tandem operations, contravention of these rules, or other just cause.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />6)      Funston Tandem Instructors must hold a current United States Hang Gliding Association Tandem Instructor rating.
<br />
