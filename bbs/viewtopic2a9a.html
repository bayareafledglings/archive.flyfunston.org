Unless a person goes to every thread to duplicate their comments, some threads will be fragmented or incomplete and people will miss important stuff!<br /><br />How about if we post club related business ONLY on flyfunston.org, then post the LINK to that post on our various social media pages? That way everyone can learn about a discussion but only have to follow one thread. All comments and discussion will be in one place!<br /><br />Does this suggestion make sense and work for everyone?</div>

In addition to keeping the information in one place, there is the huge problem of ownership.<br /><br />Remember that anything you post to most social media sites becomes <span style="font-style: italic">THEIR PROPERTY</span>. Most people don't think about the ramifications of that when they're just socializing, but a club like Fellow Feathers should always work to maintain both control and ownership of their information. If a site (like Facebook) is willing to make agreements guaranteeing control and ownership of the information, then that might mitigate the problem. But in general, I think it's wise for organizations (like Fellow Feathers) to own and control their own information.<br /><br />My 2 cents ....</div>
