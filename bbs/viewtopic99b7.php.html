			<div class="content">Revised bylaws have been proposed for the Club. They should be rejected. The bylaws will change Fellow Feathers from a group of pilots who like to fly and want to keep Funston a hang gliding site into a USHPA like organization run by a few with an indifferent or hostile membership. 
<br />
<br />     The proposed bylaws are irrelevant to our needs or requirements more applicable to the Sierra Club or R.E.I. In the context of a hang gliding club, they are confusing, complicated, undemocratic and while overlong incomplete. I doubt if those promoting the bylaws read and understand them. 
<br />
<br />     The Club’s current bylaws are four pages written in plain English. The revised bylaws are 32 pages written in legalistic jargon. The revision gives control of the Club to “directors”. Presently, however, the Club has no “directors”. It has officers. UHSPA like directors would have to be elected. 
<br />
<br />     Following are some of the objectionable provisions of the revised bylaws. “Sec.” refers to the section of the revised bylaws.
<br />	1. Directors decide who joins the Club. Sec. 3.1
<br />                2. Members may vote only on: 1. Election of directors;           2. Disposition of all or substantially all of the Clubs’ assets; 3. Mergers;    4. Dissolution.  Sec. 3.2   
<br />	3. Members cannot set dues and fees. Directors set dues and 
<br />                    fees. Sec. 3.4
<br />	4. Directors may terminate a pilot’s membership in the Club
<br />                   without a hearing and without the pilot being able to confront
<br />                   his accuser or have witnesses testify in his behalf. The 
<br />                   directors only have to gve notice to the pilot that his
<br />                   membership will be terminated. The member’s
<br />                   “opportunity to be heard” may be limited to submitting a
<br />                   written statement. Sec. 3.8(b).
<br />                5. Club meetings may be held at any place directors  
<br />                    want “within or without the State of California.” Sec. 4.1
<br />                6. With certain limited exceptions, notice of Club meetings 
<br />                    must be given “either personally or by first class, registered,
<br />                   or certified mail or by other means of written 
<br />                   communication, charges prepaid” to each member 10 days 
<br />                   before a meeting. Sec. 4.4(b)
<br />                7. Voting by mail is permitted. Sec. 4.9. 
<br />                8. Proxy voting is permitted. Sec. 4.12.
<br />                9. Directors make the “rules and regulations”. Sec. 5.1(b).
<br />               10. On behalf of the Club, directors may “borrow money and 
<br />                    incur indebtedness.” Sec. 5.1(c).
<br />               11. Vacancies in the board may be filled “by a majority of the
<br />                   remaining directors.” Sec. 5.5(d).
<br />               12. Directors may pay themselves from the Club treasury. 
<br />                    Sec. 5.7
<br />               13. Directors remove officers. Sec. 8.4
<br />               14. Directors change the bylaws. Sec. 10.4
<br />               15. Annual reports must be prepared. Sec. 10.9.
<br />
<br />     The revision provides the discussed above procedure for suspending or revoking a pilot’s Club membership but there is no provision for suspending or revoking a pilot’s flying privileges. Evidently the author was unaware that pilots may fly at Funston without being Club members.
<br />
<br />     Copies of the bylaws are available from Steve. I also have a copy and upon request will e-mail it to you.
<br />
<br />     GET A COPY AND READ IT.</div>

			<div class="content">Dan, (DB)
<br />
<br />I asked both you and Tim Herr for help with the Fellow Feathers non-profit applications but you both declined. Tim suggested that we consult with a specialist in this field so we secured the services of an attorney in San Francisco who specializes in non-profit corporate law. He and I have worked hand in hand to create a set of bylaws that work for the Fellow Feathers Inc.  
<br />I am confident that our attorney is more versed in this area of law than you are, but I still sent you a draft copy of the bylaws expecting to hear back from you with your suggestions. Instead of contributing in a positive way, you ignored the needs of the club and posted directly to the discussion board, making many false and misleading statements.
<br />
<br />I’ve taken the time to address your points only so others won’t misunderstand the provisions.
<br />
<br />As a primer;
<br />The Fellow Feathers incorporated back in 2007 as a 501 (C)(7), California Non-profit Mutual Benefit Corporation. This was done to protect both officers and club members from liability.  Our next step is to file Federal and State non-profit applications so we won’t have to pay income taxes.
<br />
<br />The old bylaws lack fundamental articles required for a non-profit corporation and must be changed or replaced. The proposed bylaws are standard issue for a 501 (C)(7) corporation that have been modified to the specific needs of the club to include important provisions like the 20 hour hang gliding at Fort Funston requirement for voting membership.
<br />
<br />
<br />Please see my replies in-between your comments. SR.
<br />
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />Revised bylaws have been proposed for the Club. They should be rejected. The bylaws will change Fellow Feathers from a group of pilots who like to fly and want to keep Funston a hang gliding site into a USHPA like organization run by a few with an indifferent or hostile membership. 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />You are wrong. The proposed bylaws will change nothing in regard to our hang gliding operations. Our hang gliding operations are separate from the corporate operations. If you read the statements in our non profit applications you would see that this process makes us even more established as a group of pilots. But you didn’t want to be involved.
<br />Your old bylaws mixed up club operations with hang gliding operations, The proposed bylaws only define the operations of the corporation and all hang gliding specific language like “Discipline” for instance, have been moved into the Fellow Feathers of Fort Funston Hang Gliding Club rules and site procedures where they belong. You evidently didn’t read the bylaws very carefully. The club will be run by the same number of pilots OR MORE than it is now not less as you state.  All board members will be elected each year as they are now. Who is indifferent or hostile? Are you speaking for yourself?
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />The proposed bylaws are irrelevant to our needs or requirements more applicable to the Sierra Club or R.E.I. In the context of a hang gliding club, they are confusing, complicated, undemocratic and while overlong incomplete. I doubt if those promoting the bylaws read and understand them. 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />On the contrary, your old bylaws are inappropriate for a non-profit corporation. If you knew very much about non-profit corporate law you would see that these bylaws are very specific to our needs. Basic example; Corporations are run by a board, but your bylaws have no provision for such. Nor do your old bylaws mention anything about indemnity or a number of other sections essential for a California corporation.  I’m sorry that you find the proposed bylaws confusing and complicated. I will be happy to try and explain them to you some time. <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.html" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> Seriously, I hate how long they are too. I also hate the language in my auto insurance, credit card disclaimer, home loan, etc. This is simply a fact of life, generated by I might add, your profession. You are saying the bylaws are both too long but at the same time you would add something to make them longer? What exactly are they missing? What would you add? Please be specific.
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />The Club’s current bylaws are four pages written in plain English. The revised bylaws are 32 pages written in legalistic jargon. The revision gives control of the Club to “directors”. Presently, however, the Club has no “directors”. It has officers. UHSPA like directors would have to be elected. 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />Your four pages in any language are are inadequate for our legal needs. I’m sorry that you have such a hard time with legal jargon but it’s just something that comes with the territory. The corporation is run by a board and not officers because that is how corporations work. You should know this. What you either failed to notice or are intentionally concealing, is that the directors and the officers are one in the same! There is still a President, VP, Secretary, Treasurer, Safety Officer, Clubhouse Manager and Technology Officer, all elected by the membership.
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />Following are some of the objectionable provisions of the revised bylaws. “Sec.” refers to the section of the revised bylaws. 
<br />
<br />1. Directors decide who joins the Club. Sec. 3.1 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />Yes, the board would have the option to not approve a membership application, but can you imagine the turn out at a club meeting if the board unjustly rejected someone’s membership?! The director would be removed from office so fast your head would spin.
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />2. Members may vote only on: 1. Election of directors; 2. Disposition of all or substantially all of the Clubs’ assets; 3. Mergers; 4. Dissolution. Sec. 3.2 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />OK, so in regard to the corporation, what else do you think members need to vote on? Remember, we are talking about corporate proceedings and hang gliding operations are dealt with in separate documents handled by the club.
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />3. Members cannot set dues and fees. Directors set dues and 
<br />fees. Sec. 3.4 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />If you have a problem with your elected officials managing club finances then please suggest language otherwise. Again, anything done unjustly would result in the directors removal from office.
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />4. Directors may terminate a pilot’s membership in the Club 
<br />without a hearing and without the pilot being able to confront 
<br />his accuser or have witnesses testify in his behalf. The 
<br />directors only have to gve notice to the pilot that his 
<br />membership will be terminated. The member’s 
<br />“opportunity to be heard” may be limited to submitting a 
<br />written statement. Sec. 3.8(b). 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />You have made a false and misleading statement. Section 3.8 clearly states the member shall have a hearing and an opportunity to be heard. Here is the exact paragraph from the bylaws:
<br />
<br />(b) The member shall be given an opportunity to be heard, either orally or in writing, at least five days before the effective date of the proposed suspension or termination.  The hearing shall be held, or the written statement considered, by the Board or by a committee or person authorized by the Board to determine whether the suspension or termination should occur.
<br />
<br />It is hard to believe that you would be so incompetent as to not understand this language. My only other assumption for your making a false statement would be that you have ill intent. Please clarify.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />DB:
<br />5. Club meetings may be held at any place directors 
<br />want “within or without the State of California.” Sec. 4.1 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />Your old bylaws don’t specify where the meetings will be held at all so what’s your point? Where else besides the clubhouse do you think we should have them?
<br />
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />6. With certain limited exceptions, notice of Club meetings 
<br />must be given “either personally or by first class, registered, 
<br />or certified mail or by other means of written 
<br />communication, charges prepaid” to each member 10 days 
<br />before a meeting. Sec. 4.4(b) 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />You have made another misleading statement since you take language out of context and don’t describe the exception. The membership applications specifically state that the address of notice shall be the clubhouse at Fort Funston, just like it is now and has always been.
<br />
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />7. Voting by mail is permitted. Sec. 4.9. 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />What is your point? Do you not want all members to be able to vote?
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />8. Proxy voting is permitted. Sec. 4.12. 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />What is your point? Do you not want the wishes of a member to be followed if they can’t attend for themselves?
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />9. Directors make the “rules and regulations”. Sec. 5.1(b). 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />Misleading statement. Again, you take things out of context and left out the part that says that changes are “not inconsistent with law, the Articles or these Bylaws”. If you think this is insufficient protection then please make a suggestion.
<br />
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />10. On behalf of the Club, directors may “borrow money and 
<br />incur indebtedness.” Sec. 5.1(c). 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />Yes, this is an important clause that we need.  For instance we can use our VISA card to pay for pizza and can get parts for the weather station on credit from Davis Instruments.  Without this language we could not leagly do this. You should know this. Can you suggest language that would better protect the clubs interests?
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />11. Vacancies in the board may be filled “by a majority of the 
<br />remaining directors.” Sec. 5.5(d). 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />What is your point? Anyone can be removed by the membership with a simple vote if they don’t like the choice.
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />12. Directors may pay themselves from the Club treasury. Sec. 5.7
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />This is your first good point and I suggest that we modify Article V Section 5.7 to read:
<br /> “Directors may NOT receive such compensation, if any, for their services as directors or officers or members of Board committees. Directors may receive such compensation for reimbursement of expenses, as the Board may establish by resolution to be just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time that the resolution is adopted.”
<br />
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />13. Directors remove officers. Sec. 8.4 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />Yes, this is how corporations work, but since the directors will BE the officers your point is irrelevant.
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />14. Directors change the bylaws. Sec. 10.4 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />Again, out of context. Members interests are protected since changes to the bylaws are limited by the multiple sub paragraphs of this section which you don’t mention. If you have other suggestions please make them.
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />15. Annual reports must be prepared. Sec. 10.9. 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />Are you serious? What do you find objectionable about the board reporting the clubs financial state to the membership? This is something the club has always done and will continue to do in the future.
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />The revision provides the discussed above procedure for suspending or revoking a pilot’s Club membership but there is no provision for suspending or revoking a pilot’s flying privileges. Evidently the author was unaware that pilots may fly at Funston without being Club members. 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />As I said before: All hang gliding specific rules are now contained in the Fellow Feathers rules and Fort Funston site regulations, which do in fact have provisions for suspending flying privileges and spell out the accused pilots privileges. The author is quite knowledgeable of our needs and suggested language for the membership application to emphasize that pilots in fact do not have to be a member to fly. Evidently you are the one who is unaware of the details, not he.
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />Copies of the bylaws are available from Steve. I also have a copy and upon request will e-mail it to you. 
<br />
<br />GET A COPY AND READ IT.
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />I agree, don’t’ take Dan Browns statements as fact, or mine for that matter. Please read the bylaws for yourself and if you have any questions or concerns please either email me or bring them up at the next club meeting.</div>

			<div class="content">There seems to be some confusion as to who will control “hang gliding operations” under the proposed bylaws. The present member run group making rules and regulations or Fellow Feathers, Inc. with its Directors making rules, regulations, setting fees, etc. There will be one organization, Fellow Feathers, Inc. 
<br />
<br />A hang gliding club’s corporate bylaws need not be undemocratic stripping members of control nor do they have to be 32 pages of jargon. The Marin County Hang Gliding Association democratic bylaws are 5 pages of plain English. See <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.mchga.org/bylaws04.PDF">http://www.mchga.org/bylaws04.PDF</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Bylaws are not written in stone. They should be amended. Times and conditions change but a new set of USHPA like bylaws are not needed. The problem was created by incorporation. For over 30 years, there was no need for incorporation. The Club, its officers and members, are protected from liability by various statues and waivers. Incorporation was an unnecessary complication that I regretfully assisted after advising against it. The solution to this unnecessary complication is simple. Disincorporate by letting the corporate status lapse.
<br />
<br />The new bylaws should be posted on the WEB site. Members like myself and others should not have to request the President for a copy. Get a copy and read it. Don’t let others make decisions for you.  Remember that other President who considered himself “The Decider”.</div>

<br />Section 4.7	Waiver of Notice.  The transactions of any meetings of members, however called or notice and wherever held, shall be as valid as though taken at a meeting duly held after standard call and notice, if (a) a quorum is present either in person or by proxy, and (b) either before or after the meeting, each member entitled to vote, not present in person or by proxy, signs a written waiver of notice, a consent to the holding of the meeting, or an approval of the minutes of the meeting.  The waiver of notice, consent, or approval need not specify either the business to be transacted or the purpose of the meeting except that, if action is taken or proposed to be taken for approval of any matter specified in Section 4.4(a) of these Bylaws, the waiver of notice, consent, or approval, shall state the general nature of the proposal.  All such waivers, consents, or approvals shall be filed with the corporate records or made a part of the minutes of the meeting.
<br />A member’s attendance at a meeting shall also constitute a waiver of notice of and presence at that meeting unless the member objects at the beginning of the meeting to the transaction of any business because the meeting was not lawfully called or convened.  Also, attendance at a meeting is not a waiver of any right to object to the consideration of matters required to be included in the notice of the meeting but not so included, if that objection is expressly made at the meeting.
<br />Section 4.8	Actions By Unanimous Written Consent.  Any action required or permitted to be taken by the members may be taken without a meeting, if all members consent in writing to the action.  The written consent or consents shall be filed with the minutes of the meeting.  The action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote of the members.

<br />(a)	This corporation shall distribute one written ballot to each member entitled to vote on the matter.  The ballot and any related material may be sent by electronic transmission that meets the requirements of Section 4.4(c) of these Bylaws.  All solicitations of votes by written ballot shall (a) state the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirement; (b) state, with respect to ballots other than for election of directors, the percentage of approvals necessary to pass the measure or measures; and (c) specify the time by which the ballot must be received in order to be counted.  Each ballot so distributed shall (a) set forth the proposed action; (b) give the members an opportunity to specify approval or disapproval of each proposal; and (c) provide a reasonable time in which to return the ballot to the corporation.  If the corporation has 100 or more members, any written ballot distributed to ten or more members shall provide that, subject to reasonable specified conditions, if the person solicited specifies a choice in any such matter, the vote shall be cast according to that specification.
<br />(b)	 Approval by written ballot shall be valid only when (i) the number of votes cast by ballot (including ballots that are marked “withhold” or otherwise indicate that authority to vote is withheld) within the time specified equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and (ii) the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required for approval at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by written ballot without a meeting.
<br />(c)	A written ballot may not be revoked.
<br />(d)	All written ballots shall be filed with the Secretary of the corporation and maintained in the corporate records for at least three years.
<br />Section 4.10	Record Date for Notice, Voting, Written Ballots, and Other Board Actions.  For purposes of establishing the members entitled to receive notice of any meeting, entitled to vote at any meeting, entitled to vote by written ballot, or entitled to exercise any rights in any lawful action, the Board may, in advance, fix a record date.  The record date so fixed for – 
<br />(a)	Sending notice of a meeting shall be no more than 90 days nor less than 10 days before the date of the meeting;
<br />(b)	Voting at a meeting shall be not more than 60 days before the date of the meeting;
<br />(c)	Voting by written ballot shall be no more than 60 days before the day on which the first written ballot is mailed or solicited; and
<br />(d)	Taking any other action shall be no more than 60 days before that action.
<br />Section 4.11	Record Date for Actions Not Set By Board.  If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for determining members entitled to receive notice of a meeting of members shall be the next business day preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, the next business day preceding the day on which the meeting is held.  If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for determining members entitled to vote at the meeting shall be the day on which the meeting is held.
<br />If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for determining members entitled to vote by written ballot shall be the day on which the first written ballot is mailed or solicited.
<br />If not otherwise fixed by the Board, the record date for determining members entitled to exercise any rights with respect to any other lawful action shall be the date on which the Board adopts the resolution relating to that action, or the 60th day before the date of that action, whichever is later.
<br />For purposes of Sections 4.10 and 4.11 of these Bylaws, a person holding a membership at the close of business on the record date shall be a member of record.
<br />Section 4.12	Proxies.
<br />(a)	Each member entitled to vote shall have the right to do so either in person or by one or more agents authorized by a written proxy, signed by the person and filed with the Secretary of the corporation.  A proxy shall be deemed signed if the member’s name is placed on the proxy by the member or their member’s attorney-in-fact, whether by manual signature, typewriting, facsimile transmission, or otherwise.
<br />(b)	If the corporation has 100 or more members, any form of proxy distributed to 10 or more members shall give the member an opportunity to specify a choice between approval and disapproval of each matter or group of related matters and, subject to reasonable specified conditions, shall provide that, when the person solicited specifies a choice in any such matter, the vote shall be cast according to that specification.  In an election of directors, any form of proxy that a member marks “withhold,” or otherwise marks in a manner indicating that authority to vote for the election of directors is withheld, shall not be voted either for or against the election of a director.
<br />(c)	Any revocable proxy covering matters for which a vote of the members is required shall not be valid unless the proxy sets forth the general nature of the matter to be voted on.  Such matters include amendments to the Articles; amendments to the Articles or Bylaws changing proxy rights; removal of directors without cause; filling vacancies on the Board; the sale, lease, exchange, conveyance, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all corporate assets unless the transaction is in the usual and regular course of the corporation’s activities; the principal terms of a merger or the amendment of a merger agreement; the election to dissolve the corporation; contracts or transactions between the corporation and one or more directors or between the corporation and an entity in which a director has a material financial interest; or a plan of distribution of assets other than money to members when the corporation is in the process of winding up, when the distribution is not in accordance with liquidation rights of any class or classes.
<br />(d)	No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of 11 months from the date of the proxy, unless provided otherwise in the proxy, except that the maximum term of a proxy shall be three years after the date of execution.  The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocably shall be governed by Corporations code section 7613.  A validly executed proxy that does not state that it is irrevocable shall continue in full force and effect until either:
<br />(1)	It is revoked by the member executing it before the vote is cast under that proxy, (i) by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked, (ii) by a subsequent proxy executed by that member and presented to the meeting, or (iii) as to any meeting, by the member’s personal attendance and voting at the meeting; or
<br />(2)	Written notice of the death or incapacity of the maker of the proxy is received by the corporation before the vote under the proxy is counted.
<br />Section 4.13	Adjournment.  Any members’ meeting, whether or not a quorum is present, may be adjourned from time to time by the vote of the majority of the members represented at the meeting, either in person or by proxy.  No meeting may be adjourned for more than 45 days.  When a members’ meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken.  If after adjournment a new record date is fixed for notice or voting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each member who, on the record date for notice of the meeting, is entitled to vote at the meeting.  At the adjourned meeting, the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting.

			<div class="content">The bylaws below are presented as an alternative to Steve’s USHPA type bylaws. USHPA bylaws are appropriate for a large organization with thousands of members who rarely if ever come together for meetings. We are a small club holding monthly meetings at which members make the rules and regulations.
<br />
<br />These bylaws are based on our old bylaws and the Marin HG Association’s bylaws. As in our old and Marin’s, members not the officer/directors control the Club making decisions on rules, regulations, etc. Pilots that the officers want to suspend are guaranteed hearings at which pilots have all the rights they have under the present bylaws including the right to have pilots testify for them. 
<br />
<br />Compare the two sets of bylaws and decide for yourself. These bylaws are four pages long. Steve’s  are 32 pages long. An incomplete version of Steve’s is posted on our WEB site. The last 7 pages are missing. 
<br />
<br />Our present bylaws require bylaw changes to be posted on the Clubhouse door prior to a meeting. Mark will be posting these bylaws on the door. Additional copies may be obtained from Mark or me.

			<div class="content">Dan,
<br />I appreciate you now offering to help but I have to point out why your bylaws are not satisfactory. I’m sorry if some of my statements seem harsh, but you are presenting a great deal of misinformation.
<br />
<br />First, the bylaws I propose we adopt are not &quot;mine&quot;, they are standard corporate bylaws provided by Gene Takagi. Mr. Takagi is an attorney who specializes in non-profit corporate law. Can you make that claim?
<br />
<br />You seem to have a grudge against USHPA and are using that to somehow cast a negative light on the proposed bylaws. What exactly it is about USHPA that you don’t like and how you think these bylaws will force the Fellow Feathers to follow suit? I say that the Fellow Feathers will continue to be run by good people elected by the membership, just as it always has.
<br />
<br />You have based your new bylaws on the old FF bylaws and the MCHGA bylaws. That in itself is what is wrong with them! You should note that both sets of bylaws were written many years ago and without regard to incorporation or modern law. Neither set is appropriate to our current needs.
<br />
<br />Specifically: Where have you addressed indemnification? This is the main reason we incorporated and your oversight would negate everything we have done to protect the club from liability.
<br />
<br />Corporations are run by some sort of board, be it directors, trustees, or other. Your claim that officers run the corporation is wrong and only indicates your ignorance of corporate law. Anyone who can spell “Google” can find this out for themselves. Our bylaws need to describe all details regarding a board and yours do not.
<br />
<br />BTW, The proposed corporate bylaws also make the directors officers, so our club will still be run by those elected by the members as it has always been.
<br />
<br />Your bylaws also fail to list members rights to the fullest extent of the law. I could go on about what you have overlooked but I hope I’ve made my point.
<br />
<br />You are trying to strike fear into the membership by making false statements. The corporate bylaws do not prohibit the members from controlling the club as you state. Where does it say members can’t change the rules? In fact, the HG rules are intentionally not mentioned in the bylaws because the bylaws only say how the corporation is run, not how the hang gliding site is run. The HG operations are described in the HG rules and site procedures.
<br />
<br />The corporate bylaws specifically state that members WILL have a hearing so your claim  that they don’t is false. In fact, the Fellow Feathers rules also state that members will have a hearing so it is guaranteed in two different documents!
<br />
<br />As for the incomplete version being posted, I didn’t realize that a discussion board topic has a text limit and I have posted the missing part. Thanks a lot for *not* bringing this to my attention. If you really wanted to help the membership you would have told me right away.
<br />
<br />The document is easier to read in PDF format and I will by happy to send a copy to anyone for review. And in standard 10 pt type it's 21 pages, not 36. Still a lot I know, but not as bad as you make out.
<br />
<br />I too will put a copy of the proposed bylaws in the announcement box to comply with your interpretation of the current bylaws.
<br />

			<div class="content">Dan,
<br />I can see this is developing into a &quot;you against me&quot; argument and that does not serve the club. I propose this solution: We have an independent third party review each of the proposed sets of bylaws, yours and the ones provided by Mr. Takagi.
<br />
<br />To insure correctness, this third party would be an attorney who specializes in California non-profit corporate law, has no prior affiliation with either one of us, and is agreed upon by both of us. 
<br />
<br />We would have this attorney render their opinion as to which set of bylaws is most appropriate for a California non-profit mutual benefit corporation. The bylaws not recommended would be retracted and the club could then vote to adopt the bylaws this third party does recommend.
<br />
<br />This review would cost money and rather than having the club foot the bill for your challenge, I suggest that you and I personally pay the bill in the following way: If the third party attorney recommends that the club adopt your bylaws then I will pay for his review service. If the attorney recommends the club adopt the bylaws provided by Mr. Takagi, then YOU pay for the review.
<br />
<br />Do you accept these terms?</div>

			<div class="content">Dan,
<br />Also to be fair, I thought I’d point out another omission of yours so you can have a chance to fix it.
<br />
<br />As you would know if you’ve been paying attention, which I assume you have, our non-member income is in excess of the 35% limit established by the IRS. Mr. Takagi wrote an eloquent solution into the bylaws that resolves that problem by creating a sliding scale for dues.
<br />
<br />How would your bylaws resolve the IRS issue?</div>

			<div class="content">It has been observed that the weaker the argument, the stronger the personal attacks. Personal attacks only harm the person making them. 
<br />
<br />The bylaws the attorney gave Steve are what my profession calls “boilerplate”. They are called “boilerplate” because they are form bylaws. An attorney punches a couple of keys on the keyboard, adds a few words about the specific organization and produces 32 pages of bylaws. The bylaws are suitable for a large organization like USHPA with thousands of members whose size prevents the members from holding meetings at which the members make and vote on the rules, regulations, dues, etc. USHPA type organizations need directors to make these decisions.
<br />
<br />We are a small group meeting monthly. Our members are perfectly capable of making the rules, regulations, dues, etc. The danger of members not making the rules was seen last year when the Club officers held a disciplinary hearing and the majority of officers voted to impose an unusual penalty upon a pilot. The penalty was so unusual and unfair that the pilot decided to quit flying rather than accept it. Fortunately I was able to get the penalty reversed because it violated our member made rules and bylaws. If the penalty had not been reversed, Funston and the sport would have lost a highly respected veteran pilot who has been a friend and mentor to many.
<br />
<br />As to the others issues raised by Steve, a third attorney should not make the decision on the bylaws. The members make the decision. The “problem” of non-members contributing more than the permissible 35% of the Club’s income is not a problem. The solution is simple. Take less money from non-members. The money comes from donations the non-members make when they get stickers. When a projected 35% is reached, stop taking donations or put the donations in a separate account rather than the Club treasury. The donations could be used for the WEB site, site maintenance or some other improvement.
<br />
<br />The Club doesn’t even need donations. The Club already has too much money in the treasury. We have thousands of dollars in reserve to replace a Clubhouse roof that Larry said had been replaced by the GGNRA.</div>

			<div class="content">Dan,
<br />I’ve re-read you proposed bylaws and see that you now agree that directors will run the corporation. I apologize for focusing on your previous arguments that so adamantly disputed this fact and have retracted my posting. We could have avoided this if we had just talked in person.
<br />
<br />
<br />While I believe that your bylaws are now not in conflict with the California corporation code, I still think that they lack three very important elements:
<br />
<br />First, you have not included a provision to indemnify the directors. This is a very important clause that would protect any future directors from liability. This will not affect me since this will be my last tenure as president, but I’m thinking of anyone else who owns a home or has a bank account that can be attached were the corporation to be sued.
<br />
<br />I also think it would be a huge mistake to not address the IRS issue. Yes, we could limit our budget to just 34% over our member (clubhouse) dues, but this could put the club in serious jeopardy.  Right now we have about 100 members x $30- = $3,000- x 1.34 = $4,020- . I need to double check with our Treasurer, but I don’t think this amount would cover our current annual expenses even IF you take out the $1,000- annual allocation for re-roofing. If the membership dropped we would either go bankrupt or have to raise membership dues for the remaining members. Why would you want to place this burden on Voting Members when so many others are willing to contribute? In addition, funds above and beyond our current needs can be used for site improvements like relocation of the drinking fountain, new benches and tables, you name it.
<br />
<br /> Please note that our Special Use Agreement requires us to maintain the entire clubhouse building including the roof, so if the roof was replaced recently as Larry says, we will still need $10,000- to $15,000- to replace it when it starts to leak. Where will that money come from if we don’t save it ahead of time? It is very easy to institute a sliding dues scale, and I only see it having a positive affect on our members don’t you?
<br />
<br />My last concern with your bylaws is the Article III, Purposes. It is important to have our non-profit application approved the first time around and Mr. Takagi has been very careful to write language that puts emphasis on the aspect of us being a social club. Your bylaws don’t have the same language and might cause our application to be rejected. I’m sure you wouldn’t want that so can’t you please copy the Purposes wording from the other bylaws?
<br />
<br />My only goal in this debate is to protect the interests of the club and I would like to avoid a lengthy series of arguments that are likely to get ugly. How about you and I set our differences aside and do what is best for the membership? If you are willing to modify your Article III and write an indemnity clause and sliding scale membership into your bylaws, I think we can agree on a compromise. It would be most effective for you to do that ahead of time so we won’t have to debate modifications to your bylaws at the meetings, but we can do it that way if you insist. If you can’t see your way to this compromise I will argue for the adoption of bylaws that do contain these elements.
<br />
<br />The club is facing a deadline to apply for non profit status and long delays will cost us real money in delinquent taxes. Won’t you please accept this compromise and as you said, “Save the Fellow Feathers”?
<br />
<br />And lastly, how about we talk in real time from now on? I think we could make good progress if we worked together rather than against each other. Thanks for your help.</div>

			<div class="content">There are several issues raised by Steve’s 5.7.09 post.
<br />
<br />1. Indemnification Of Officers and Directors:
<br />Indemnification means the Club, the members, pay the “expenses, judgments, fines, settlements” of the “director, officer, employee or other agent” of the corporation for the mistaken and in certain cases the criminal acts of the “director, officer, employee or other agent” committed in a corporate capacity. 
<br />This provision is standard for a large corporation. We are not a large corporation. The basis of our sport is responsibility for our own conduct. In the past Club officers including myself have served without indemnification. The bylaws of the Marin Hang Gliding Association, the Bay Area Paragliding Association (BAPA) and the Wings of Rogallo have no indemnification provision.
<br />
<br />2. The Roof:
<br />The status of the roof is confused. If we are responsible for maintaining or replacing it, why did the GGNRA replace it? Years ago we did replace the roof and it cost a few thousand dollars. Times have changed and it may be more expensive. A committee should be appointed to investigate the matter and determine how much, if any, the Club should set aside for the roof.
<br />
<br />3. The 35% Requirement:
<br />The Club must develop projected budgets for the next several years. This cannot be done until the roof costs are known. When the roof costs are known, we can determine the amount of yearly revenue the Club requires and the extent of donations. Donations also could be directed to a special roof fund and not the Club treasury.
<br />
<br />4. The Bylaws Being Rejected By The IRS :
<br />This is unlikely as Enzo leaving his wife and marrying Emily.</div>

If the roof were replaced by the GGNRA and we were not charged it was a mistake, and not something we should plan our finances on.<br /><br />I measured the square footage of our portion of the roof (not including the BAAQMD annex) and called a roofing company for a ball park figure which was 10 to 15 thousand dollars.  I don't see why this simple task would require a committee, but if you want to check with someone else I will be happy to appoint you as chairman of the roofing committee.<br /><br />A written estimate might make you feel better but is only a hint of what something will cost in the 10 to 15 years a typical tar and gravel roof lasts. Considering for inflation and the rising cost of oil, it's reasonable to expect the future roof to cost much more than today. We can get a more exact estimate if we want to pay for it but since we are going to have to guesstimate so much of our future cost I think it would be a waste of club money.<br /><br /><br />DB:<br />3.

The money in our budget is currently being earmarked for the roofing fund. The IRS views donations as part of the club income, so they effect the 35% ratio.

<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;SR: I didn't say the bylaws could be rejected, I said our non-profit application could be rejected. And it could quite easily if we are not careful.

<br />Our bylaws are part of the non-profit application package and will be examined along with all the other  supporting documents with which we are trying to prove our eligibility. Mr. Takagi has more experience in this field than you do and knows what the reviewers will be looking for. That is why his language should be used and not yours. No offense intended.</div>

			<div class="content">“Indemnification” is reimbursing somebody for his loss, damage or liability. Under the form bylaws the Club must reimburse the officers and directors for damages they suffer for their misdeeds while acting in a corporate capacity. For example last year a veteran Funston pilot was going to quit the sport because of the penalty imposed upon him by several officers at a club disciplinary hearing. The penalty violated our bylaws. After I learned about it, I e-mailed the officer responsible demanding that the penalty be withdrawn. The officer aware that he would be financially responsible for his conduct immediately withdrew the penalty and the pilot resumed flying. If the officer had not withdrawn the penalty, the pilot could have sued probably recovering several thousand dollars. Under the proposed form bylaws, the Club would have to reimburse the offending officer for what he would have had to pay to the pilot. 
<br />
<br />Under the form bylaws, a pilot’s right to a hearing is severely limited. The so called hearing may consist simply of the accused pilot submitting a written statement. Under our current bylaws the pilot is guaranteed a real hearing at which at which at least one witness to the violation or offenses testifies and at which the accused pilot has the following rights: Notice of violation; Notice of hearing; Name of witnesses to violation; Opportunity to questions witnesses; Opportunity to be heard; and Opportunity to produce witnesses.
<br />
<br />The roof and dues issues are for the members to decide. The confusion surrounding the roof is an example of the recent tendency to make the simple complex. Ask the GGNRA who is responsible for the roof. It is dishonorable for us to remain silent when a landlord as incredibly generous as the GGNRA repaired a roof that the Club President believes is our responsibility. 
<br />
<br />Our corporate neighbors, BAPA, WOR, MCHGA, have no difficulty with their bylaws. They did not need an “expert” to provide them with a boilerplate form. 
<br />
<br />The flying was good today at the Fort. Tomorrow is Mother’s Day and the granddaughter will be here. No more posts. Read both bylaws. Come to the meeting.</div>

<br />Now that I’m home from vacation I have a bit more time to devote. (BTW the Smithsonian aviation museums in DC are incredible!)
<br />
<br />I did more research and learned that the indemnity clause in our incorporation documents does in fact allow the board of directors to grant indemnity on a case by case basis, so I now agree that it is not essential that it be in the bylaws.

<br />The roof and dues issues are for the members to decide. The confusion surrounding the roof is an example of the recent tendency to make the simple complex. Ask the GGNRA who is responsible for the roof. It is dishonorable for us to remain silent when a landlord as incredibly generous as the GGNRA repaired a roof that the Club President believes is our responsibility. 
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />True, the budget IS for the members to decide, which they did when they approved the budget that allocates money for the roof, so your arguing against it is pointless.
<br />
<br />Your bylaws currently state “ARTICLE VII: FISCAL YEAR 
<br />The fiscal year is from December1 to November 30.” But the membership has previously voted to have the FF fiscal year run from Oct 1 through Sept 30. You wouldn’t want to go against the membership would you? You could either change your dates, or better yet, not even have them in the bylaws, just let them be set by decree of the board.
<br />.
<br />
<br />There is nothing confusing about the paragraph in our SUA that specifically states that we are responsible for roofing, among other things. The FF has been taken by surprise to learn from Larry that the GGNRA re-roofed the building on their own. Today I asked the local GGNRA maintenance leader how this could have happened and he said it must have been on an old work order and that these things take time to get done because of budget limitations. I asked him how the Fellow Feathers might donate to the GGNRA and have the money allocated to Fort Funston. He said he would try and find out. This could be an excellent use of our moneys.
<br />
<br />Everyone is acting in good faith so I wish you would restrain from accusing us of being dishonorable. Wasn’t it you who stated “It has been observed that the weaker the argument, the stronger the personal attacks. Personal attacks only harm the person making them.”? 
<br />
<br />DB:
<br />Our corporate neighbors, BAPA, WOR, MCHGA, have no difficulty with their bylaws. They did not need an “expert” to provide them with a boilerplate form.
<br />
<br />SR:
<br />As I said before, their bylaws were not written with incorporation in mind and are not a good example.
<br />
<br />Unless there are members who feel strongly that we adopt the bylaws suggested by Mr. Takagi, I’m willing to work on your bylaws to get them more acceptable. This would include correcting the fiscal year dates and adding to the statement of purpose among other small changes that we can discuss at the meeting.
<br />
<br />I too want to stop this back and forth between us. I trust the intelligence of our membership and that they will make a good decision based on the facts presented.</div>
