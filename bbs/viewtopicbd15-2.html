				<h3>Important Decisions at the Upcoming USHPA BOD Meeting</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Sat Sep 30, 2006 4:19 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">The fall USHPA Board meeting starts next Thursday evening and all members are welcome to attend the meeting.  There will be an open session on Saturday morning and it is likely that discussions and votes on important issues, including powered gliders and harnesses, will occur.
<br />
<br />I urge you to attend the Saturday morning session to learn how the USHPA works and to let the Board know what you want from the USHPA.  Saturday may be the last opportunity you have to talk to the Regional Directors in person.  (The last BOD meeting in the Bay Area was in the late 80's.)  Don't miss this opportunity to have an impact on the future of our organization.    Please bring all your flying friends too.  The best way to get USHPA to listen to us is for us to show up and talk to them.
<br />
<br />The session starts promptly at 8:00am at the Crowne Plaza Hotel, 1177 Airport Blvd. Burlingame, CA (just off of Highway 101, south of the San Francisco International Airport).
<br />
<br />If you have any questions, please let me know.
<br />
<br />I hope to see you all there Saturday morning.
<br />
<br />Dave</div>
