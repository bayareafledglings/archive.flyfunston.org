				<div class="content">This is turning into a Pot Luck affair!
<br />It would be wonderful if everyone could bring a little something to share with others, anything from salad to side dish, to desert would be great. The club will BBQ the beef and chicken and have the basic essentials.
<br />We are all looking forward to a fun get-together!</div>

				<h3>Ice chests wanted!</h3>

				<div class="author">by <strong>Steve Rodrigues</strong></div>
				<div class="content">We could use about 3 more ice chests!
<br />
<br />I just bought a bunch of sodas and juice, and I know Rafie could use at least one for the meat.
<br />
<br />If you are willing to bring an ice chest 1/2 full with ice, please give me a call.
<br />Thanks!

				<h3>PG Fly By</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Fri Aug 22, 2008 8:33 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Steve Rodrigues</strong></div>
				<div class="content">A PG pilot I know just called to ask permission to do a PG group fly-by in honor of Dan Murphy.
<br />
<br />I am quite aware of the sensitivity of this request but also respect their gesture.
<br />
<br />I told him that our special use permit prohibited PG flying at Fort Funston but in the name of camaraderie and good will, it would be OK for them to come to the north end of the training bowl on this one time special occasion.
<br />
<br />They will plan on coming from the Dumps as a group, making a few passes, then heading back south.
<br />
<br />Having just experienced a reminder of my own mortality I can testify that this life has no time for prejudice.
<br />Please hold this gesture as a salute to our fallen comrade.
<br />
<br />PS; I'll ask around at the BBQ for feedback about this and call it off if too much negative response.</div>

				<div class="content">The BBQ and Fly-in was a great success!
<br />There was a really big turnout with lots of cool old gliders on display and in the air too! We were blessed with great flying all day so everyone who wanted to fly could get their fill. Good food, good air, and most of all good friends. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.html" alt=":-)" title="Smile" />
<br />Thanks to everyone who chipped in, we did Dan proud!</div>

				<div class="content">I've posted a ton of photos taken yesterday at the BBQ. A great time was had by all. Some highlights for my family:
<br />
<br />1) John Simpson's girlfriend is a cutie!
<br />4) My mom got to fly tandem with Steve. Thank you!!
<br />2) My daughter carrying Ramone's daughter's Chihuahua all around.
<br />3) I don't think I've seen Obi Wan Mark stay in the air for that long a time.
<br />5) The food was plentiful and yummy!
<br />6) Flying in front of the clouds before the blue sky disappeared at Westlake. Awesome!
<br />7) Did I mention John Simpson's girlfriend is a cutie?!
<br />
<br />Enjoy the photos here:
