				<div class="content">.<br />GGNRA SUP Negotiation Update<br /><br />Both the BAPA and Fellow Feathers GGNRA Special Use Permits expire this year. The GGNRA is not prone to renew either of our permits until our two clubs come to a mutual agreement and write common language for our permits that will put an end to the disputes, conflicts, and bickering that have been going on for far too long.<br /><br />A joint committee was formed to work out some common language agreements. The committee came up with six basic rules that we can agree on, but one issue still remains unresolved, that being the current restriction that prohibits BAPA members launching at the Stables from flying north of the south rim of the Funston Training Bowl.<br /><br />Many members of the Fellow Feathers would like to keep the boundary in place, while many BAPA members would like to have the restriction removed. Our SUP’s can’t have it both ways, so rather than have the GGNRA arbitrarily choose one way or the other, a third option would be for the two clubs to agree to some sort of compromise that would involve partial lifting of the boundary restriction with certain limitations. A potential draft compromise can be found here: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopicae71.html?f=5&amp;t=1710">viewtopic.php.html?f=5&amp;t=1710</a><!-- l --><br /><br />If our two clubs cannot agree on a boundary compromise, the GGNRA can decide for us, but is willing to accept the recommendation of USHPA.<br />Having the boundary decision made by USHPA pilots who understand our aircraft flight characteristics would be much better than having it made by someone who does not even fly.<br /><br />USHPA would be willing to mediate binding arbitration with the two Chapters, but only if the clubs agree in advance to accept the results of the arbitration.<br /><br />It is now up to BAPA and the Fellow Feathers to find a way to get their SUP’s renewed. Please attend the next Fellow Feathers meeting on Tuesday, August 11 to discuss the above issues. BAPA members are invited to attend but should also monitor the BAPA website and email for additional options.</div>
