				<div class="content">Fort Funston in 2015<br /> <br />Fort Funston has had one of the most consistent years of flying in its history. Almost every day was flyable this summer; and the good conditions continued right into the fall. Start planning now for next year by renewing your membership early and receiving your sticker by mail.<br /><br />The details for “Stickers by mail” are here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../sticker.html">http://flyfunston.org/sticker.php.html</a><!-- m --><br /> <br />Please note that the Fellow Feathers needs to keep better track of membership applications and hang gliding permits. As such, we will be limiting sticker distribution to a smaller number of club officers. That means that there will be many days when stickers will NOT be available on-site. If you really want to fly the Fort, it is highly recommended that you get your helmet sticker well before you intend to come out.<br /> <br />Thanks for preparing in advance.  See you in the air!<br /><br />The Fellow Feathers of Fort Funston Hang Gliding Club</div>

Sticker just came in the mail.  Looks like the turn around is about 1.5 weeks door to door at least to Fremont.  Not to shabby.  Thanks to whoever is doing the stickers.</div>

				<div class="content">I may or may not recall (getting old sucks), point is I can't find the sticker and am in need of a replacement. What is the procedure for sticker replacement? What if I got a new helmet, what would be the established procedure to get a replacement sticker issued‽</div>

				<div class="content">.<br />Sorry, but if you lost your helmet sticker you won't be able to fly again until next year when we issue new stickers.<br /><br />He-he, kidding of course, just mail Rob a SASE with a note that you need a replacement sticker. We will update the database with your new sticker number, noting that your previous sticker number is invalid.</div>
