				<h3>Thanks From Hat Creek Rim</h3>

				<div class="content">On Saturday, May 27th, during this year’s annual Hat Creek Rim Memorial Weekend informal fly-in, the Hat Creek Volunteer Fire Department was presented with 300’ of Kernmantel rescue rope.  Over the years, the fire department, and the Hat Creek community for that matter, has been very supportive of flying at the Rim.  
<br />
<br />The Hat Creek Committee was contacted by the fire chief and asked if they could help replace the old rope that had become unserviceable.  Considering the great support of the fire department and the emergency services they have provided pilots in the past, the committee thought it reasonable to help out.
<br />
<br />We wanted to pass this information along to the flying community to
<br />illustrate the value of user donations and to thank supporters of the Rim.  Hat Creek Rim survives on donations from the flying community and support from volunteers.  Without the support of volunteers, donations, sales of t-shirts and helmet stickers, this purchase of rope would not have been possible.  
<br />

<br />
<br />The Shasta Sky Sailors and Hat Creek Committee thank you for your support.
