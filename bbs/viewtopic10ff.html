<br />May 19-22: The 2005 Coyote Howl Fly-In and Cloudbuster Hootenanny at Lake McClure, California.  Meet directed by USHGA Vice-President Lisa Tate.  Free-flying and XC Thursday & Friday, May 19-20, organized meet Saturday & Sunday, May 21-22.  $20 pilot participation fee includes raffle and event prizes.  The flying is great at that time of the year, and the partying should live up to our normal high standards.  Contact Shannon Raby for meet information: <!-- e --><a href="mailto:getusum@inreach.com">getusum@inreach.com</a><!-- e --> or (209) 878-0249.
<br /> 
<br />Saturday night hootenanny, $25 for dinner and show by Doodoo Wah, Sourdough Slim, and The Saddle Pals, advance ticket purchase required.  Fast paced, hilariously entertaining show will make you hoot and howl and holler, maybe even slap your thighs!

<br /> 
<br />Great flying Thursday through Sunday, butt-kicking entertainment Saturday night, and friendly locals will make this a memorable event and one you won’t want to miss.

<br /> 
<br />
<br />HERE’S WHAT YOU’VE GOTTA DO:
<br /> 
<br />RSVP is appreciated but not required for the Fly-in, or the Mexican dinner Friday nite, or the breakfast Sunday morning; just showing up is OK too.
<br /> 
<br />But if you want to get in on the Hootenanny, because the room is so small and we expect to have more folks wanting in than we have room for, we need to have the concert tickets prepaid.  We can hold tickets for will-call at the door, but only if they've been prepaid.  Sorry we've gotta be so strict, but we're dealing with real live musician/entertainers, and this is gonna be show to remember.  The room holds about 100, we have about 30 tickets left as of 4-10-05.
<br /> 
<br />You can mail payment, $25.00 per person covers the Saturday nite meal and Hootenanny, to me:
<br />Accent Corp
<br />8250 Ferguson Ave
<br />Sacramento, CA 95828
<br /> 
<br />If you'd rather use a credit card via Paypal to my email address, send $26.05 for 1, $51.80 for 2, or $103.30 for 4.
<br /> 
<br />If you include your return address, I'll mail your tickets out to you, otherwise we'll hold at the door for will-call.  The tickets themselves are collector's items, you'll love 'em.
