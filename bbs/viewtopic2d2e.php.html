				<h3>Dog poop violation reporting</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Sun Jun 29, 2008 10:43 am</strong></div>

				<div class="content">There have been ongoing issues with certain dog walkers not picking up after their dogs, and this has sometimes led to tense situations with other folks at Fort Funston.
<br />
<br />The GGNRA is not enforcing any leash laws until an official policy is put into effect. Unfortunately, the proposed rule making won’t be finalized for a couple more years. In the mean time, it is important for us to document any dog walker violations of the Code of Federal Regulations (36 CFR).
<br />
<br />There are two specific parts of the CFR’s that apply to dog walker issues.
<br />First;
<br />
<br />36-CFR (5) § 2.15 Pets.
<br />“Failing to comply with pet excrement disposal conditions which may be established by the superintendent.”
<br />
<br />The (2007) Superintendent's Compendium  §2.15 (a)(5)
<br />“Pet excrement must be disposed of  in accordance with the following condition:
<br />   •  In all areas of the park pet excrement shall be removed immediately from the park or deposited in a refuse container by the person(s) controlling the pet(s).”
<br />
<br />Second;
<br />
<br />36-CFR § 2.34 Disorderly conduct.
<br />“(a) A person commits disorderly conduct when, with intent to cause public alarm, nuisance, jeopardy or violence, or knowingly or recklessly creating a risk thereof, such person commits any of the following prohibited acts:
<br />
<br />(1) Engages in fighting or threatening, or in violent behavior.
<br />
<br />(2) Uses language, an utterance, or gesture, or engages in a display or act that is obscene, physically threatening
<br />or menacing, or done in a manner that is likely to inflict injury or incite an immediate breach of the peace.
<br />
<br />(3) Makes noise that is unreasonable, considering the nature and purpose of the actor’s conduct, location, time of day or night, and other factors that would govern the conduct of a reasonably prudent person under the circumstances.
<br />
<br />(4) Creates or maintains a hazardous or physically offensive condition.
<br />
<br />(b) The regulations contained in this section apply, regardless of land ownership, on all lands and waters within a park area that are under the legislative jurisdiction of the United States. [48 FR 30282, June 30, 1983, as amended.”
<br />
<br />
<br />If you witness a violation to any of these regulations, you are encouraged to call the Park Police and report it. It will help to quote these CFR numbers as reference.
<br />
<br />If you need urgent intervention by an officer you should call the EMERGENCY dispatch number: 415-561-5656
<br />
<br />If intervention is not required but you would like to file a report, please call the NON emergency dispatch number: 415-561-5510.
<br />
<br />Thank you for your help!</div>

<br />The next update won't be until Spring 09' when the Draft is ready for public comment.
<br />We should prepare to gather our forces, make comments, and designate the HG setup area off limits to off leash dogs.</div>

				<h3>Please report all dog problems</h3>

				<div class="content">I just got the following email from our GGNRA contact:
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&quot;some advice from Law Enforcement.  Yvette Ruan is the Chief Law Enforcement Ranger and she requested that Fellow Feathers members report issues with dogs immediately to Dispatch at 415-561-5505.
<br />
<br />If you aren't able to report it on the spot, she said you can email her a request to make a formal report at <!-- e --><a href="mailto:yvette_ruan@nps.gov">yvette_ruan@nps.gov</a><!-- e -->.
<br />
<br />These reports will allow the Park to better understand the severity of the situation and could help build a case for changes out at Fort Funston in the longer term.&quot;
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />I ask all pilots to help make change happen at Fort Funston: Please call or write to Dispatch and report any dog related issues.
<br />
<br />Thank you!</div>
