<br />From the redwood forests of the Phleger Estate in San Mateo County to Alcatraz to the Marin Headlands, millions of people every year enjoy the natural splendor of the Bay Area's pre-eminent national park, the Golden Gate National Recreation Area.
<br />
<br />But behind the 75,500-acre park for nearly a quarter-century was a soft-spoken ranger, a lover of the outdoors who devoted his career not only to opening some of Northern California's finest landscapes to the public, but redefining what a national park could be.
<br />
<br />On Wednesday, following complications from a heart attack, Brian O'Neill, superintendent of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, died. He was 67.</div>

<br />
<br />
<br />As many of you have already sadly been informed, our beloved Superintendent, Brian O'Neill, passed away peacefully this afternoon with his family by his side.  His family then gathered at Crissy Field and took in the beauty of the place as their way of honoring him and feeling his
<br />presence.   All of our hearts are heavy with sorrow for this great and
<br />unexpected loss.
<br />
<br />By mid-afternoon tomorrow we hope to begin posting memorial or service plans as they evolve and information on where to send condolences to Brian's family.  This information will be posted on the park's website:

<br />Thank you to everyone for your caring expressions of love for Brian and his family.

<br />With this follow up:
<br />
<br />
<br />Many of Brian O'Neill's friends and colleagues have inquired about a ceremony to honor Brian's zest for life.
<br />
<br />
<br />A date and location have been set for this celebration: May 29 at Crissy
<br />Field.   A specific time has not yet been set, but additional details will
<br />follow shortly.</div>

				<div class="content">I worked with Superintendent O'Neill in the early days of the Club. He was a friend and supporter of hang gliding and under his leadership Funston has remained a hang gliding only site.
<br />
<br />To acknowledge his contriubtions to hang gliding and the Recreational Area, I recommend that the Club make a generous donation in his name to the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy or to any other charity designated by his family.</div>
