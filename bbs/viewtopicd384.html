				<div class="content">Dan Brown and I have been working together on rules that will clarify the way the Fellow Feathers informs it's members of important notices.<br /><br />We would like to first raise the idea of having public notices posted on the FF web site instead of the clubhouse door. This change, if voted for, would require amending our club Bylaws and take two months of voting to go into effect.<br /><br />We talked about the differences between public and private notices and have agreed that:<br /><br />1)	Private notices are for confidential matters like suspensions or clubhouse evictions, and that those notices should go directly to the member by USPS mail or email, that they should NOT be made public. <br /><br />2)	Public notices are to announce club or BOD meetings where voting members can vote on things like rules, bylaws, etc. , and that public notices should be posted on the clubhouse for all to see (and/or posted on the web site).<br /><br />With the above in mind, we will propose that the following language be added to the Fellow Feathers rules:<br /><br />“Sec. ____ NOTICE<br />          1. Reasonable notice of suspension or removal of a glider from the Clubhouse shall be given by delivery to either the member's last known postal or e-mail address.<br /><br />          2. Notices provided for in the Bylaws, shall be given by posting on the Clubhouse.”  <br /><br /><br />We will also propose that the agreement of notice line on the membership forms shall be amended to read:<br /><br />“In accordance with F.F. Bylaws Article XII, Section 1, This member stipulates by signature that for “purpose of notice”, official notifications shall be posted on the Fellow Feathers clubhouse, Building FF-206, Fort Funston, San Francisco, CA.”<br /><br /><br />Please note: In both of the above rules, “Clubhouse” could be replaced by “Website”, depending on how the club votes.<br /><br />See you all next Tuesday!<br /><br />Steve R.</div>
