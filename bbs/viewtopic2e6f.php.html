Wayne, JT, and CRV had some fun at Windy Hill on New Year’s Day - cloud base was around 3k.  Marina also delivered some great conditions over the holidays.<br /><br />President’s Report (Joey Villaflor):  Working on some graphics for a new Funston t-shirt - working on an introduction video to help new and visiting pilots.  In the meantime, pilots should read Kent Harker’s Funston Primer which is available on the Club’s website.<br /><br />Vice President’s Report (Wayne Michelsen):  Nothing to report.<br /><br />Secretary’s Report (Chris Valley):  December meeting minutes posted.<br /><br />Treasurer’s Report (Lisa Lesser):  Nothing to report. <br /><br />Clubhouse Officer’s Report (Rob Johnson):  Reminder - Clubhouse members will not receive stickers until they have paid their Clubhouse dues this year and beyond.  Would like to redo the racks in the Clubhouse and repaint.<br /><br />Safety Officer’s / Launch Maintenance Report (John Simpson):  Need to keep up with launch maintenance.  1/2 day launch maintenance work party is being considered.
