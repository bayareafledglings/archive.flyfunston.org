				<div class="content">The weather vane on the voice wind talker is stuck.  Just because it's stuck at WSW doesn't mean it's flyable <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.html" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />.  
<br />
<br />Steve R is going up to lubricate it in the next few days.  In the meanwhile:
<br />
<br />1) The wind speed for the voice wind talker is accurate.
<br />
<br />2) The wind speed and direction on the web (<!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../newwebcam/index.html">http://flyfunston.org/newwebcam/</a><!-- m --> ) is accurate.
<br />
<br />3) Just to triple-check, have a look at the windsock in that webcam to see what it's doing.

				<div class="content">Sunday 9-30-07; Found wind talker weather vane has bad bearings, couldn't get it free with just lube. Maybe Astroglide wasn't the best choice. Have to order new weather vane from Davis Instruments, will get it up as soon as it comes.</div>

				<h3>Wind readings on web site</h3>

				<div class="content">The &quot;17 MPH&quot; reading on the wind dial is not changing, so it's clearly been taken out by the bad temp gauge.  I can explain more in detail in email if anyone really wants it.  
<br />
<br />The every-few-minutes wind speed and direction in the weather charts (just below the dial) is correct.  
<br />
<br />Bummer about the weather vane.

				<h3>Getting back online</h3>

				<div class="content">I replaced the temp/humidity sensor.  There are now live temp/dewpoint readings showing up on the webcam page.  
<br />
<br />The wind dial is being a bit of a pain due to the bad data from the Dark Period(tm).  I'll reset it in the next couple of days.  Most of the changes I can do remotely but there's one double secret step that may require a trip to the Fort. As a result, I'll only take that step when I am free to make an emergency house call on site.
<br />
<br />If any of you are interested, we use WView <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.wviewweather.com/">http://www.wviewweather.com/</a><!-- m --> to run the weather station.  It's open source and can use a few modifications for our purposes, so if you're game and are a C/*nix person let me know.

				<div class="content">The web-based weather station is now completely back online, including updates to the wind dials. We'll keep an eye on everything to make sure it's working fine.  
<br />
<br />As an aside, the latest problem was that SOMEONE had accidentally turned off the computer that drives the weather reports.  I think they accidentally unplugged it while plugging in an RC plane charger.  Don't do that anymore, m'kay?</div>
