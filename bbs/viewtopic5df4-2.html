				<div class="content">As of December 10, 2013, the dugout is off limits.<br /><br />The GGNRA came out to inspect the site this week and told us that the dugout is now permanently off limits and that we need to keep it filled in.<br /><br />Background: The club had previously been reprimanded for excavating a deep pit under the bush and we wound up filling it back in almost all the way.<br /><br />Tom Rust convinced the GGNRA that the pit, or &quot;safety dugout&quot; was needed for safety reasons so they said we could keep using it as is, as long as we did not dig it out any further. They took photographs of the dugout for their records and we promised that we would not dig it out again.<br /><br />Somebody went ahead and dug the pit out again which violated our agreement and got the park supervisors upset that we broke our word (One more black mark on our record). That action, combined with the NPS desire to discourage anyone from using the bush for Illegal activities, has now cost us the dugout.<br /><br />As the U.S Park Police had already stated: All area inside the bush is considered “Off trail” and is off limits. The GGNRA rangers are now on the same page.</div>
