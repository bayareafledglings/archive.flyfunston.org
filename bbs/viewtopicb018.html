				<div class="content">As mentioned in November's meeting minutes, below are the nominations that took place during our 11/12/13 club meeting:<br /><br />President - Tracey Story, Rob Johnson, Tim West, Zac Majors. Rob declined the nomination. <br />Vice President - Rob Johnson, Tom Rust.<br />Secretary - Tom White, Chris Carrillo<br />Treasurer - Van Pelham.<br />Safety Officer - David Kiesling. Dave replied that he wasn’t sure yet if he’d accept the nomination. <br /><br />Chuck Kranz was also nominated for Technology Officer. <br /><br />I wish to express my deep gratitude to all those who have been supportive of me this year as President and for the strong encouragement to run again. Even though there were many challenges this year, it has been an honor to serve you. <br /><br />I've decided, however, to decline the nomination to run again. I know from speaking with many of you that you understand my decision and I thank you for that support as well. <br /><br />Additional Board nominations can be made at tomorrow's club meeting that will be held at the Moose Lodge located at 776 Bradford Street, Pacifica, CA 94044. The meeting will begin at 7:30pm.</div>
