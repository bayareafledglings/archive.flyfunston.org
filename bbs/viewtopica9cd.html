<br />Sunday, April 16, 2006
<br />8:45 am - 3:00 pm
<br />San Francisco County Fair Building Hall of Flowers – Rec Room
<br />9th Avenue and Lincoln Way
<br />Ample free parking. Great lunch restaurants nearby.
<br />Bring 2 IDs (one with picture), a pencil and
<br />$20 in cash for study materials and test OR
<br />$14 for test only (general, extra, Morse tests available too).
<br />Questions to <!-- e --><a href="mailto:dave1@wcf.com">dave1@wcf.com</a><!-- e --> . Drop-ins OK. Don’t be late!
<br />Beginners’ self-study starts 9:00AM. Exams at 11AM, 2PM, 3PM.
<br />No need for advance preparation, our method does it in 6 hours.
<br />NEW! General exam class at 9:15AM (if you are already licensed) NEW!
<br />Next test not until June, 2006. Latest info: wcf.com/sfares/exams
<br />Passing this test will get you a ham radio license from the FCC good for
<br />10 years. You will be able to use:
<br />O local repeaters for Bay Area communication,
<br />O Echolink for Internet-based radio,
<br />O satellite and moon-bounce,
<br />and if license restructuring goes through, you may be grandfathered to
<br />use international shortwave frequencies for global communication!
<br />Come and join the great world-wide community of ham radio.
<br />Sponsors/supporters:
<br />SF Neighborhood Emergency Response Team
<br />San Francisco Fire Department
<br />SF Amateur Radio Emergency Service
<br />SF Amateur Radio Club
<br />Bay Area Red Cross
<br />Salvation Army more info follows W5YI-VEC
<br />How our system works:
<br />Ross Patterson learned that short term memory was a fantastic aid for
<br />retaining answers to test questions for an hour or two. From this he
<br />devised his famous “ham cram”, which consists of rapid scanning of
<br />questions and answers for just a few hours, then sitting down and taking
<br />the test. His method has consistently achieved pass rates of 70-95%.
<br />This method does NOT teach you how to be a radio operator, or even the
<br />material which underlies the test questions.
<br />This method focuses on your PASSING the test. This is step one in
<br />becoming a ham radio operator.
<br />Step 2 is to buy a radio, and Step 3 is to learn how to use it. We sell an
<br />inexpensive book to help with Step 3 right after the exam.
<br />Step 4 is to get on the air, and get experience checking into nets that are
<br />used for preparedness and drill. As you progress in Step 4, you may wish
<br />to act as net control for a net some evening.
<br />But first things first–get your license. And that is what this day’s
<br />activities are all about.
<br />Because the test focuses on SHORT TERM memory, there is little
<br />purpose in getting the test materials in advance. If you want to do some
<br />advance preparation, get hold of a high-school physics book and read the
<br />part about the relationship between wavelength and frequency. Or:
<br />Wavelength x Frequency = Velocity
<br />For radio waves, we use the velocity of light, 300 million meters per
<br />second. If we measure frequency in Megahertz (1 million cycles per
<br />second), then the formula becomes meters x megahertz= 300. So if I ask
<br />you what is the wavelength of a 150 Megahertz signal, the answer is 2m.
<br />If you need to convert meters to feet, multiply by 3 and add 10%. A
<br />half-wave antenna has one-half wavelength elements. A conventional
<br />dipole has 1/4 wavelength elements.</div>
