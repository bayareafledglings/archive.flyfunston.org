				<h3>Dog Walker Incident Report</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="../../flyfunston.org/bbs/styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Thu Jun 19, 2008 9:53 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">On Tuesday there was another incident at Funston between Tailwaggers (Layne Zimmerman) and a hang glider pilot. Zimmerman called the police. The police took reports from Zimmerman and the pilot and gave citations to Zimmerman and to the pilot. The U.S. Attorney’s Office is reviewing the reports to determine whether to bring criminal charges. The police told the pilot that reports of previous incidents with Zimmerman would be given to the U.S. Attorney. 
<br />
<br />It is important that the U.S. Attorney be provided with reports of all incidents between pilots and Zimmerman; not just the few incidents that have been reported to the police. The Club is requesting that pilots who have had incidents, reported or unreported, with Zimmerman prepare Incident Reports. The Club will give the Reports to the U.S. Attorney. The goal is to make the U.S. Attorney aware of a pattern of conduct by Zimmerman and to prevent criminal charges being brought against the pilot. 
<br />
<br />We need to act quickly before the U.S. Attorney makes a decision. Each incident should be on a separate Incident Report. Please give the completed Reports to Raffy, Larry or Dan Brown. 
<br />
<br />The Incident Report should include the following: 
<br />1. Date, time, place of incident; 
<br />2. Accurate description of incident. Do not exaggerate; 
<br />3. Signed Declaration at end of Report stating: 
<br />“I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws 
<br />of the State of California that the above is true 
<br />and correct and signed this _____ day of June, 
<br />2008. 
<br />Pilot Signature________ 
<br />Print Pilot Name
