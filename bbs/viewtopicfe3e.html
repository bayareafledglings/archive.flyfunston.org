				<div class="content"><span style="color: blue"><span style="font-weight: bold">I'm not sure what constitutes the need for an accident report, but I bent a downtube on landing today.<br /><br />I launched into moderate wind and slightly turbulent conditions and climbed into very strong, smooth lift and flew to Westlake where I played around for about 20 minutes. The wind was picking up and turning more northery.<br /><br />Descending through about 800'msl the air became pretty rough as I expected. I set up on final and was getting tossed around a bit, but manageable. After getting through the gradient, I was pretty lined up when a strong lateral gust yawed me to the right. My right wing was now slow and low and, trying to prevent a groundloop to the right, I gave a quick jerk of a control input in &amp; left.<br /><br />The base bar hit fairly soft except that I was now slipping to the left and my body hit the left downtube.<br /><br />The following glider, also a topless, ended up on it's back during landing with no apparent damage.<br /><br />The next following glider groundlooped and whacked, but again with no apparent damage.<br /><br />The last flexy was Tim who made it look pretty easy!!<br /><br />I'm glad no one got hurt.<br /><br />Jim</span></span></div>

<br />
<br />Can you identify what was the principal cause of the incident? What would you have done differently to avoid injury or damage?

Nobody was injured.<br />It was the third flight with a new harness, in which I'm still adjusting, but I didn't feel like the harness was causal.<br /><br />jim</span></span></div>

				<div class="content">Jim and Dan,
<br />
<br />I watched most of the landings that afternoon as did others.  I think what would have helped most of the pilots who had some trouble would have been to simply pull in for more speed and have a more aggressive final approach.  I saw people still trying to "float in" like we often do at Funston when conditions are less wild.  With conditions so turbulent and rotor-like in the LZ, we need more speed to allow better control of the glider in those conditions...I remember saying to myself "pull-in...pull-in" on many of the landings I witnessed later that day...
<br />
<br />A couple of the launches were pretty interesting to watch, too...YIKES!
<br />
<br />My hats off to whoever was flying the Millenium that day...that was a text book landing!
<br />
<br />~Chris</div>

				<div class="content">I agree with Chris that many pilots need more speed on final. You almost can't have too much, up to the point that supports a PIO.
<br />
<br />Chris, did you notice a common problem with the launches, or care to point out what not to do, or need to do better?</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="color: blue"><span style="font-weight: bold">I guess I launched before it got gnarly, because it was not that bad for the first twenty minutes or so.<br /><br />I do appreciate the critiques!<br /><br />Hopefully everyone that flew, or just watched, will walk away with another nugget of experience.<br /><br />jim</span></span></div>
