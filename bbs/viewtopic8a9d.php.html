				<div class="content">Hi everyone,<br /><br />I was a pilot at Fort Funston in the 2000-2003 time period and since moved to Boulder, CO.  I sorely miss flying Funston and hope y'all realize how lucky you are to have such a great site to fly.   I'm coming back for a visit in early June with my family and was wondering if anyone would be willing to rent/lend me a glider just to get a nostalgic flight in and show my family what it's all about. I have had a H-4 since the late 90s, fly a Litespeed 4 but can fly most any glider, am a very safe pilot, and know Funston's gotchas well (although things may have changed since then).  I would be very gentle on the glider.  Please send me a note at my email (***b o b k a n i c k  AT  m s n . c o m***  minus the spaces of course) if you're willing. <br /><br />Regardless, I hope to stop by just to reminisce and ruminate on how I can get back to SF to fly here once again!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Bob</div>

				<div class="content">Update:  Someone with whom I flew back in the day has graciously offered his glider to me.  Thanks for reading everyone, y'all are one of the best flying clubs I know.  I look forward to seeing some old friends in June and hopefully the wind gods will give me a flight!</div>
