				<div class="content">lots of people knew it would be good flying . not me .  i got there late, whacked  6 landings in an hour.   not really, LZ was very good MOST of the time , except when Grubbsy came in and it went north as he was descending . you can see on the weather machine graph ,at 4:30 pm exactly, it changed back to winter ,  northy and no good.<br />very buoyant over the ocean about 1/4 mile out. <br />Tracey , George A and I worked on clubhouse :   new key mailing, i just sent out  45 keys and stickers to voting members.  To  the people with a space in the Clubhouse, thanks for your donations and support for your volunteer staff , by mailing your applications to me in Nov or Early December, which is just the right time ,  so we have time to tie up all the loose ends , and you'll have your sticker on New Years Day 2014 .    You need your new key on Feb first.  the old keys are brass color, the new keys are silver.</div>
