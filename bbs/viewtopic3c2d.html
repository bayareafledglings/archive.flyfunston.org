				<div class="content">Proposed Revision to Clubhouse Rules<br /><br />Clubhouse Members are required to pay their annual dues no later than January 31. Unfortunately, some members put off paying their dues until very late in the year, and only then after much follow up by the Clubhouse Manager.<br /><br />In support of our volunteers, and to incentivize members to pay their dues on time, the FF EC is proposing to add a penalty for non-payment. Please see red highlighted language in rule # 2, below.<br /><br />The club voted to revise the Clubhouse Rules at the January 7 club meeting. As required, a second vote will be held to adopt the finalized language.<br /><br />Members are encouraged to review the attached draft and attend the February 4th club meeting to cast their vote.<br /><br />Thanks for participating in *your* club!<br />Sincerely,<br />The FF EC<br /><br /><br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br /><br />FORT FUNSTON CLUBHOUSE RULES &amp; WAIVER<br /><br />1.
