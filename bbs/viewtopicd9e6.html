				<h3>Re-organizing the Executive Committee</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Sun Dec 07, 2008 7:57 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">The club has evolved over the years and I think it's about time to re-organize the Executive Committee and revise the Bylaws to reflect any major changes.
<br />
<br />The club dropped the Westlake sticker program years ago, so the Westlake Director really has nothing to do at this point. A VM from our current Westlake Director Gordon Pollock confirms that a Westlake Director is not much of an asset to the club.
<br />
<br />I propose we eliminate Westlake Director from the Executive Committee.
<br />
<br />
<br />The club is in real need of a Technology Officer. Please see the discussion topic at; <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../flyfunston.org/bbs/viewtopicba4a.html?t=693">http://flyfunston.org/bbs/viewtopic.php.html?t=693</a><!-- m --> 
<br />
<br />I propose we add Technology Officer to the Executive Committee.
<br />
<br />This would keep the number of club officers at an odd number and eliminate the likelihood of a tie vote.
<br />
<br />
<br />In addition, we should re-write the job duties of some officers;
<br />
<br />Now that we have a computer data base that keeps track of voting/clubhouse members as well as stickered pilots, someone needs to do data entry. This could probably be added to the Secretary's job, or perhaps be shared with the Treasurer.
<br />
<br />With the new &quot;combined&quot; membership/sticker application for voting/clubhouse members, the keys and stickers get mailed together. This combines some of the work of both the Vice President and the Clubhouse manager.
<br />
<br />Since these are new combinations of work it will probably take a trial period to figure out what works best. I suggest that we try it out for a year to work out the bugs before we revise these job descriptions in the bylaws.
<br />
<br />Please come to the club election meeting next Tuesday, December 9th, offer your opinions and suggestions, and vote!</div>

				<div class="content">The concept of dropping Westlake Director and creating Technology Officer was supported my almost every member at the December meeting.
<br />
<br />Notice of proposed Bylaws amendment has been posted in the announcement box at the clubhouse front door.
<br />
<br />This Bylaws amendment will be put to vote at the next two consecutive meetings, Jan and Feb 2009.</div>
