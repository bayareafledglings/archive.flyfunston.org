				<div class="content">Thanks to all of you, last Saturday's exam was a 
<br />great success, over 90% passing.  And two new 
<br />general class operators passed Morse code and the 
<br />theory test.  Our next Ham Cram will be 
<br />11/5/2006..  Don't forget the General Theory 
<br />cram for those who are looking to do more.....

<br />8:45AM SHARP! - 3:00PM

<br />9th Avenue and Lincoln Way
<br />Ample free parking.  Great lunch restaurants nearby.
<br />Bring 2 IDs (one with picture), a pencil and
<br />    $20 cash for technician study materials and test OR
<br />    $14 cash for test only (general, extra, Morse tests available too).
<br />
<br />8:45AM Don’t be late!   Questions to <!-- e --><a href="mailto:dave1@wcf.com">dave1@wcf.com</a><!-- e -->  drop-ins OK.
<br />Beginners’ tips at 8:50, self-study starts 
<br />9:00AM.   Exams at 11AM, 1:45, 2:45PM.  No need 
<br />for advance preparation, our method does it in 6 hours.
<br />NEW!  General exam class at 9:15AM (if you are already licensed) NEW!
<br />
<br />Next test not until Feb. 2007.  Latest info: wcf.com/aero/exams
<br />
<br />Passing this test will get you a ham radio 
<br />license from the FCC good for 10 years.  You will be able to use:
<br />         O     local repeaters for Bay Area communication,
<br />         O     Echolink for Internet-based radio,
<br />         O     satellite and moon-bounce,
<br />
<br />and if license restructuring goes through, you 
<br />may be grandfathered to use international 
<br />shortwave frequencies for global communication!
<br />
<br />Come and join the great world-wide community of ham radio.

<br />
<br />
<br />How our system works:
<br />
<br />John Portune, W6NBC, discovered and Ross 
<br />Patterson developed and perfected a technique 
<br />based on the fact that short term memory was a 
<br />fantastic aid for retaining answers to test 
<br />questions for an hour or two.  From this Ross 
<br />devised the famous “ham cram” (rapid scanning of 
<br />questions and answers for just a few hours, then 
<br />sitting down and taking the test).  His method 
<br />has consistently achieved pass rates of 70-95%.
<br />
<br />This method does NOT teach you how to be a radio 
<br />operator, or even the material which underlies the test questions.
<br />
<br />This method focuses on your PASSING the 
<br />test.   This is step one in becoming a ham radio operator.
<br />
<br />Step 2 is to buy a radio, and Step 3 is to learn 
<br />how to use it.  We sell an inexpensive book to 
<br />help with Step 3 right after the exam.
<br />
<br />Step 4 is to get on the air, and get experience 
<br />checking into nets that are used for preparedness 
<br />and drill.  As you progress in Step 4, you may 
<br />wish to act as net control for a net some evening.
<br />
<br />But first things first–get your license.   And 
<br />that is what this day’s activities are all about.
<br />
<br />Because the test focuses on SHORT TERM memory, 
<br />there is little purpose in getting the test 
<br />materials in advance.   If you want to do some 
<br />advance preparation, get hold of a high-school 
<br />physics book and read the part about the 
<br />relationship between wavelength and frequency.  Or:
<br />
<br />Wavelength x Frequency = Velocity
<br />For radio waves, we use the velocity of light, 
<br />300 million meters per second.  If we measure 
<br />frequency in Megahertz (1 million cycles per 
<br />second), then the formula becomes meters x 
<br />megahertz= 300.  So if I ask you what is the 
<br />wavelength of a 150 Megahertz signal, the answer is 2m.
<br />If you need to convert meters to feet, multiply 
<br />by 3 and add 10%.   A half-wave antenna has 
<br />one-half wavelength elements.  A conventional 
<br />dipole has 1/4 wavelength elements.</div>
