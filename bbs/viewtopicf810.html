				<div class="content">Why is it meeting minutes always posted late? What this does is keep members that could not attend in the dark. Or,<br />is that the reason behind it. That's the kind of thing Harry Reid does. Voting is a breeze that way. <br />POST THE MEETING MINUTES!!!  Folks, this is deception!!  And a show of hands is not a vote!  Both require members <br />that have ten hours the previous year!!  <br /><br />rick hawkins</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Rick,<br /><br />I just sent an email to Tom asking him to post the Minutes ASAP.<br /><br />I agree with you that the meeting Minutes should be posted in a timely fashion, but I can assure you that even though this month’s delay is a bit longer than usual, there are no big secrets being hidden!<br />Please keep in mind that the club meetings are open to the public and enough people come to the meetings and know what’s going on that word of any “secrets” would quickly spread.<br /><br />Because of this, there is NO benefit in intentionally delaying posting of the Minutes. In fact quite the opposite, because long delays can make members wonder what’s going on, and also make the EC look bad!<br /><br />In regard to delays, please remember that everyone is a volunteer and has a busy life, so not everything gets handled as quickly as it could. <br />Generally speaking: After the meeting takes place, it usually takes two or three days for the Secretary to sit down and type up their hand written notes. Then they send the draft minutes to the EC for approval and to see if they missed any details or got anything wrong.<br /><br />Because everyone on the EC has busy schedules and some are often out of town, it can take a week or more to hear back from everyone. After receiving feedback and/or approval, the secretary then has to make any edits and post the finalized Minutes.<br /><br />Depending on circumstances, it is not unusual for the entire process to take two weeks. As of today we are only 2 ½ weeks out, so it’s not as bad as one might think.<br />Hope this helps alleviate your concerns.</div>

				<div class="content">And to clarify any confusion about the September meeting: The show of hands at the meeting was in support of *proposing* the amendment, not on the amendment itself.<br /><br />Official voting for the proposed amendment begins at the October meeting, as was announced here: <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="viewtopic958a.html?f=8&amp;t=1728">viewtopic.php.html?f=8&amp;t=1728</a><!-- l --></div>
