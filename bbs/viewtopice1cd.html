				<div class="content">The annual Dan Murphy Memorial BBQ will be held on Saturday, August 15. A re-birth of the Funston Air Races is expected to take place the same day!
<br />Everyone is invited to come fly and hang out. The BBQ will be fired up in the afternoon and the timed flights to Westlake will start whenever it becomes soarable. Anyone interested in helping with the BBQ (shopping, meat flipping, etc) should contact Rafael Lavin. Those who would like to help with the Air Races (timing, record keeping, etc) should contact Steve Rodrigues. Rumor has it that certain Tandem Instructors might even be offering free flights!
<br />See you there!</div>

				<div class="content">I can't run the Air Races without more volunteers and will have to drop it from the BBQ schedule.
<br />I need at least four more volunteers to help out: Two people to each take a one hour shift monitoring the Westlake turn point, and two more people to do timing at the start/finish pylon on launch.
<br />Please contact me if you can help!
<br />Thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">Just a quick note to say thank you to all the volunteers who helped put on the BBQ and Air Races. We had a huge turnout and I think everyone had a great day. We couldn't have done it without the generosity of those folks who donated their time and energy. Thanks to all!
<br />
<br />I'd like to hold another Air Race in the Spring when strong conditions are more dependable and am looking forward to another event where our membership steps forward in such a great way!
<br />
<br />Thanks again!</div>

				<h3>FF Air Race</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Mon Aug 17, 2009 9:56 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Urs</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Thanks to all the volunteers, participants and spectators that made this a fun race and a great BBQ. 
<br />
<br />Seeing 8 gliders on the beach at one time showed the go for it spirit that prevailed during the race.
<br />
<br />I've been to 4 other air races and ended up on the beach each time, twice a t Torrey Pines, twice at the Marina Steeple Chase (middle of the course). I kinda expected to do so during this race as well.
<br />
<br />I didn't free fly before the race so I didn't know how light the winds were until I returned to the Fort and let the bar out. Had I free flown beforehand, I may not have ventured to Westlake.
<br />
<br />Thanks again to all!

<br />here's some pictures I took  at the  turnpoint.
<br />
<br />The food  was  gastronomical.  
<br />
<br />Gracias  to the  many who  pitched  in .
<br />
<br />(off topic,
<br />at the  clubhouse putting away gliders , at dusk,   a  young  woman  walked up in a gorgeous flowered  dress and  amazingly high pumps,  hobbling on the rough pavement  from the Olympic  Club.
<br />She said  she had  been at a wedding  at the  Club , broke up  with  her  boyfriend , and  was left  stranded at Funston  by...him, the dirty rat.
<br />
<br />  I believe Lisa T and  Wayne M helped her out, before the Rangers  closed the place)
<br />
<br />BTW   thanks for  dropping  in Lisa, always great to  see our Prez

<br />It still was lots of fun I am glad I ran the course even though I technically did not finish it. I got to work on that line heading back.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_eek.gif" alt=":shock:" title="Shocked" />
