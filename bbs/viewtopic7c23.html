				<div class="content">It looks closer then it actually was.  It was at least a 100-200' west of the surf line and turned further out when it got a bit further south where a glider was flying.</div>

				<div class="content"><span style="color: blue"><span style="font-weight: bold">I didn't answer the question of how close a helicopter can fly to the cliff...<br /><br />Helicopters may be operated less than the minimum altitudes prescribed (for airplanes) as long as they do not present a hazard to persons or property on the surface.<br /><br />What about in flight, you ask?<br /><br />In general, if you see an aircraft, you are responsible to avoid it, regardless of what you're flying (some exceptions for airships, hot-air balloons and gliders -we are not "gliders" in this definition)<br />However, any aircraft that is being overtaken (that would be us flying at 30mph) has the right-of-way over the overtaking aircraft.<br /><br />Additionally, helicopter pilots are advised in the AIM that they best know the hazards associated with their own rotorwash and responsible for safe altitudes and airspeeds.<br /><br />...lot's of legal rope for us professional pilots to hang ourselves with!!<br /><br />jim harris</span></span></div>

				<div class="content">I think that might have been the third that came through. I was on the launch when the first two came through and I waved them off with my arms at the same time they went further out (hope they saw the gliders at westlake and turned because of them and not me). When this third flew by Chris was in the air and banked his wings and it went a little further out to sea (did ya get some inflight video?). I did get into a little of the wake of a small plane out at westlake, realized it and bolted out of there real quick like. It was a great day though and glad I started to feel ill at work  <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.html" alt=":wink:" title="Wink" /></div>
