				<div class="content">Fellow Feathers Club Meeting, May 12th, 2009
<br />
<br />Meeting started at 7:30PM...
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Members Present:</span>
<br />
<br />Larry C, Chuck K, Raffy, Tim W, The Lilledahl Brothers, Eric C, Dan B, Mike Q, Dirk M, Patrick D, Dingo Dave, Daniel M, Patrick #2, Adrian, John S, Steve R, Chris V (acting Secretary), Charlie N, Monte C, Walter, &amp; Damian
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Discussion Items:</span>
<br />
<br />Steve ask if anyone had any good flights to report.  He mentioned that he and Mike Jefferson had some fun assisting with an episode of Myth Busters at the Fort...stay tuned.  A couple shears have been sprinkled here and there and summer flying fun is here!
<br />
<br />Steve mentioned that he has been working with the GGNRA on a 5-year special use permit.  The GGNRA is writing hang-gliding into their Master Plan, as well.  This is good news.  We need to maintain our current healthy relationship with the GGNRA.
<br />
<br />Members are encouraged to document / report incidents where dog walkers do not pick up doggy-doo.  It was also reported that 3 pilots and the wife of one pilot have either been bitten or nipped at by unleashed dogs.  This needs to be documented and reported, as well.
<br />
<br />Did I mention we need to maintain our current healthy relationship with the GGNRA?
<br />
<br />The evening discussion then led to the wording of our by-laws now that we are incorporated.  Dan Brown presented sample by-laws from similar Bay Area flying clubs and offered suggestions on how to keep our by-laws down to 4 pages rather than the proposed 32 page by-laws previously considered.  Dan explained the simplified 4-page version of our proposed by-laws will meet legal requirements for incorporation and allow Fellow Feathers to manage our club the way we have in the past.
<br />
<br />The pilots present all agreed to entrust Dan to write and fine tune the simplified version of our by-laws in-lieu of previously proposed 32 page document.  The new by-laws will be posted and discussed / voted on at our next meeting.  
<br />
<br />We voted to change the membership dues by making non-voting membership dues on a sliding scale from $5- to $29.99.
<br />
<br />The membership also voted to add email notification to the bylaws.
<br />
<br />Daniel M. discussed the current budget briefly...
<br />
<br />The Safety Officer reported that we need to maintain our current healthy relationship with the GGNRA...
<br />
<br />The Clubhouse Manager reported that we need to maintain our current healthy relationship with the GGNRA...
<br />
<br />The Secretary continued writing stating that we need to maintain our current healthy relationship with the GGNRA...
<br />
<br />The topic of how we conduct ourselves while representing the club and sport of hang-gliding was discussed, also.  We all need to remember that flying at Fort Funston is a privilege and this privilege can and will be taken away if we don't treat park staff and fellow park visitors with respect.    
<br />
<br />Got it?
<br />
<br />The meeting adjourned at 9:07PM...all pizza was consumed.
<br />
