Steve reminds the members that we need to keep the place looking nice and not cause any problems. The broken windsock pole (strong winds) was recently replaced by Ward, and others who helped install it.<br /><br />OLD BUSINESS<br /><br />Rob’s clubhouse maintenance - Rob swept and attempted to paint the clubhouse floor as planned but couldn’t get the floor warm enough. The floor needs to be warm for the paint to dry. The exterior safety light was installed as planned and is operational. There is a lot of stuff in the clubhouse that has piled up again since the last cleaning where pickup truck loads of stuff was hauled away. <br /><br />Westlake cam – The issue with Tom R and the cost of the webcam has been resolved. There is an additional $80 outstanding for the purchase cost of the webcam that the club is accepting donations to cover.<br /><br />Competitions – Mark M is still brainstorming comp plans. The annual Air Races event is still on and he won’t mess with it. He suggests possibly a 2 day event, possibly taking over the park and charging admission. Members have doubts about whether that would be allowed. Mark said something about something that would cost $20,000-$25,000 and could be paid for by sponsors. Further discussion referred to committee composed of Mark M, Rob J, Steve R, and Zac M.<br /><br />NEW BUSINESS<br /><br />Windsocks – 2 windsocks have been ordered by Larry.<br /><br />Tracey reminds the club to be considerate of paragliders and pedestrians.
