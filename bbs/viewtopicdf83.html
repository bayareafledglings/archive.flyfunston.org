<br />
<br />We would like to honor a fellow pilot that has contribute so much to our sport and to life.  We could not think of a better way and that is to fly in his honor. 
<br /> 
<br />We are NOT getting together to mourn a loss but to Celebrate a life.  
<br /> 
<br />Come one come all - family, friends, hangs and para 1-5's  
<br /> 
<br />So come 'Celebrate Steve's life'. Our Club Presdient and so MUCH MUCH more. 
<br /> 
<br />Novemeber 18th at Ed Levin.  For all flying skills. 
<br /> 
<br />Ed Levn: 
<br />10:30am till ?? Would like have a moment of silence at 12:35pm. 
<br /> 
<br />Finger food, beverages, etc etc provided by WOR. 
<br /> 
<br />Steve's family will be there as well as Deb and Deb's kids. Hopefully friends outside of flying. 
<br /> 
<br />I would like to especailly invite the Diablo team to share some stories, his friends that knew him outside of flying and of course his family.  
<br /> 
<br />An Annual fly-in in honor of Steve is also in the works. 
<br />
