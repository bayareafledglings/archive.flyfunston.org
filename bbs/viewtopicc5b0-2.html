				<div class="content">The Fellow Feathers are looking for a few good men (and women!) to help with the fountain relocation project. The goal is to move this attractive nuisance farther away from our HG area in order to shift the dogs and dog walkers away from us!<br /><br />The good news is that GGNRA has approved our relocation proposal to move the drinking fountain and dog water station to the north west corner of the parking lot. The task at hand will be to dig a trench 30” deep and 200’ long, and install a new 1” PVC water line, from the old drinking fountain to the new location,.<br /><br />The bad news is that we have to do the construction work mid week, Monday thru Friday. That time restriction makes it tough for many of us working stiffs to get to the Fort much before 6:30 PM, which only leaves a couple hours of daylight each day to trench, lay pipe and backfill. This can be done in stages if we have a coordinated crew.<br /><br />What we need are solid commitments from a team of volunteers so we can schedule a start date.<br />Who is willing to commit to working mid week? Can anyone start earlier in the day or put in longer hours? Also, since Eric is out of commission, we need a supervisor to insure the work is being done correctly.<br /><br />If you would like to help us with this project, please contact me off line or come to the next club meeting at the Clubhouse, 7:30 PM , Tuesday June 14.<br /><br />Thanks!<br />Steve<br />srskypuppy at earthlink dot net</div>
