<br /> 
<br />Tandem Administrator Greg De Wolf is planning to come up from LA and hold a three day Tandem clinic on October 24-26.
<br /> 
<br />This clinic will provide all the required information for a Tandem Instructor rating. Participants who successfully pass all the requirements will receive the rating appropriate to their skill level and previous ratings.
<br />In other words; first time participants may receive their T-1 rating, those who already hold a T-1 may receive their T-2, and those who hold a T-2 may receive their Tandem Instructor rating. Since all the instructional requirements will have been accomplished, future tandem rating upgrades may be had upon completion of required flights and a successful check-ride. Note; Tandem ratings are not guaranteed, all pilots must pass the written test and demonstrate the appropriate skills.
<br /> 
<br />This clinic will consist of a Friday evening classroom discussion to be held in San Jose, and Saturday and Sunday days at Ed Levin park in Milpitas. The cost is $300-, all equipment will be provided.
<br /> 
<br />As of October 4 we only have four participants and we need at least six total to make it viable for Greg to come up from So Cal. Please contact me ASAP if you would like to commit to the clinic.
<br /> 
<br />Cheers!
<br />Steve Rodrigues
<br />Tandem Instructor, USHPA 30605
