				<div class="content">Attention Voting Members (clubhouse members)<br /><br />You should be receiving your 2011 membership forms in the mail this week.<br />The cover sheet with instructions was accidentally left out so here it is:<br /><br />2011 Fellow Feathers Voting Membership and Sticker application. Please read!<br /><br />Some critical events took place in 2009 that continue to affect the club. Conflicts with spectators and the failure to cooperate with the GGNRA / National Park Service law enforcement officers put our hang gliding permit in serious jeopardy. As a result, we (Fellow Feathers members) MUST be on our best behavior or risk losing our permit to fly at Fort Funston. There are two areas of prime importance:<br />1: All members are mandated to cooperate with rangers and other law enforcement officers.<br />2: There is a zero-tolerance position on the 25’ rule;<br />“No pilot may fly within 25' of any person on the ground. Pilots must yield to pedestrians and people on horseback. No pilot may launch when there are spectators in the launch area. Courtesy, especially toward spectators, is mandatory of all pilots.”<br /><br />Remember that we are “Park Partners” and are being held to high standards. The FF rules state: “IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY PILOT TO KNOW, UPHOLD, AND ENFORCE THESE RULES”, so please take responsibility and step in to defuse any conflict you may be aware of.<br /><br />GGNRA permit holders must pay a Service District Charge for the buildings they occupy. As a result, our clubhouse costs the club $2,734.48 per year. We must also carry property insurance, currently costing us $756.00 annually. In order to balance our budget, the annual dues for voting members is $65.00.<br />After submission of your application and assuming there is space in the clubhouse, you will receive your clubhouse key and helmet sticker in the same envelope! Please note that the clubhouse lock will be changed on February 1, 2011.<br /><br />Send your completed forms, dues check, and a SASE (self addressed stamped envelope) to:<br />Charlie Nelson<br />3101 Page Street<br />Redwood City, CA 94063<br /><br />Your membership dues not only pay our “rent” but are also put to good use maintaining the clubhouse, web cam, weather stations, hosting community events, and funding site improvements. Your generous donations help support hang gliding at Fort Funston and are greatly appreciated.<br />Thank you!<br />The Fellow Feathers Executive Committee<br /><br /><br /><br />BTW, Do NOT return the FF rules, they are yours to read!!!<br /><br />Non-voting members can get their 2011 FF sticker from Chris Valley. Please see his post at the top of this discussion board.</div>
