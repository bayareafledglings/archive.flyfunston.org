				<h3>Clubhouse renovation</h3>

				<div class="content">If I had the authority, I'd appoint the amazing and selfless Rob Johnson as  king of the clubhouse renovation! Without anyone asking, he's filled in all the holes and other openings in the building with concrete and cinder blocks, covered all the windows with plywood and trimmed them and the front door, as well as concrete saw cut and installing the trench drain. He has power washed, primed and painted all the walls and trim of the entire building.
<br />
<br />I'm sure he would appreciate anyone who wanted to help complete the project!</div>

				<div class="content">If the path and trail relocation concept is approved, I volunteer to lead both projects since they dovetail.
<br />Same for the drinking fountain if nobody else steps up once we have approval for it.</div>

				<div class="content">I can help with stuff in a couple months after I move to that side of the bay and get situated. Or the stuff that I'm convinced is needed anyway. I don't have skills like nunchuku skills, bow hunting skills or computer hacking skills, but I'm okay at labor that doesn't require much thought.

				<div class="content">Holy Moeley!!  How did I miss this little thread? 
<br />
<br />Steve...  Your too kind... thanks for the compliment.... 
<br />
<br />As for the clubhouse and additional work Im all in.... I dont have much more to do on the outside of the clubhouse other than cutting in, few places to scrape (again) and repaint... walk in da park.... 
<br />
<br />We do still have a list of things inside to address (moving all the lockers and cleaning behind them, painting the floor etc, we want to get the mold and moisture out as well) 
<br />
<br />As for the new work...... ( I dont want to hog all of it but I will if I have to) 
<br />
<br />Installation of new drinking fountain: 
<br />Talent - Rob
<br />
<br />Design proposal for replacement of walkway to observation deck: 
<br />Talent - Rob
<br />
<br />?  We might be able to remove the old boards and plane them down an 1/8 of an inch and re-install them upside down......Would save a shtload of cash...... 
<br />
<br />Either way, put a pile of boards in front of me (and a pizza) and I&quot;ll bang that pathway out in 1 day....... alone.....  So Bring iT!!!!
<br />
<br />Site prep for possible walkway changes: 
<br />Talent -  Rob
<br />
<br />Painting and weatherproofing of clubhouse: 
<br />Project Coordinator - Rob Johnson 
<br />Talent  Rob  (and whoever) 
<br />
<br />There isnt any project I cant do for the club so lets knock out some of this list.....
<br />
<br />Happy flying
<br />Rob</div>
