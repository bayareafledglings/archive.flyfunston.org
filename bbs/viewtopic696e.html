				<h3>New H-2 Rules</h3>

				<div class="content">New H-2 Rules.
<br />
<br />For almost 3 decades, Fort Funston has been an H-3 rated site and had rules that only allowed H-2's to glide directly to the beach. In 2008 we changed the rules to allow H-2's the chance to soar under certain conditions. Unfortunatly we didn't write enough detail into the new rules and there have been some recent incidents that mandated further definition of H-2 parameters. The following rules were voted into place at the February 2009 club meeting.
<br />
<br />Please remember that rules can always be changed or modified by club vote, so if there is a particular line in the new rules that you feel strongly about, please start a topic for discussion.
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />H-2 Rules, revised 2/10/2009
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />9. All H-2 launches must be sponsored by an Advanced Funston pilot or Mentor. On their first four (4) flights, an H-2 must glide directly to the beach without attempting to soar. On subsequent flights, H-2’s may soar only if approved to do so by their Mentor or an Advanced Funston pilot.
<br />
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />A)  All H-2 flights, from launch to landing, shall be under direct supervision of their sponsor.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />B)  H-2 pilots shall be limited to smooth winds of 15 mph or less, and gusty winds of 10 mph or less.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />C)  H-2's may fly only as far north as the drain pipe just north of launch, and only as far south as the south end of the training bowl below the golf course.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />D)  H-2’s must land on the beach. (No top landings).
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />E)  H-2's must fly a bright colored 6’ streamer from their kingpost.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />F)  If an H-2 violates any Fellow Feathers rule during their sponsored flight, their sponsor shall be subject to the same suspension.</div>

				<div class="content">The new H-2 Rules need refinement. 
<br />         1. The only grounds for suspending the sponsor for the H-2’s violation should be for sponsoring a flight by a pilot that the sponsor knew or should have known was unqualified.   
<br />        2. The Rules says nothing about the number of H-2s in the air at the same time. In light air Funston can be dangerously congested.	
<br />        3. Since the H-2 is going to land on the beach, flights should be permitted only when the beach is not crowded.
<br />       3. After four flights, an H-2 is still an H-2. If the H-2 wants to soar at Funston, he should become an H-3.  
<br />       4. Presumably an “Advanced Funston Pilot” is a Hang IV pilot but what is an “Advanced Funston pilot”? Is it a Hang IV with a certain number of hours at Funston?</div>

				<div class="content">The size of the Gusts are very important along with consistent direction.
<br />
<br />Under these rules, many of my H2 trips to the training area would not have been possible. 
<br />Can I assume there were severe reasons for these non-soaring  H2 restrictions?</div>

<br />
<br />I think Dan brings up some very good points that need to be discussed...

				<div class="content">These are good points but trying to discuss all of them in one thread will be very confusing. I' will start a topic with each one so we can hash em out. <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.html" alt=":-)" title="Smile" /></div>
