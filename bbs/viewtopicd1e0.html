				<h3>Minutes 11 March 2008</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Wed Mar 12, 2008 9:59 pm</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>Gw.</strong></div>
				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Fellow Feathers<br />11 March 2008<br /><br />Present were:</span>
<br />
<br />the usual, and new faces, among whom Van (new H2), Tim (1st meeting in 10 years of flying the Fort), Jim. 
<br />
<br />Another shear today, second day in a row.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Topics were:</span>
<br />
<br />- New anemometer is up and shows good readings.
<br />- New dog do bag dispenser installed by the water fountain.
<br />- About 10 members are unpaid and will not receive keys until paid up.
<br />- Web systems (webcam, membership databases) have been moved to more robust servers.
<br />- Unclaimed lockers padlocks have been cut (notices have been posted for a long time). Items will be placed in purgatory and will be sold at auction next year (valuables will be stored elsewhere).
<br />- This year auction/BBQ is scheduled for 12-13 April.
<br />- Sticker donation form will be amended to include a line to suggest applying for membership.
<br />- One suspension was issued for violating the 25' rule.
<br />- Reminder: touch-and-goes are <span style="text-decoration: underline">unsafe and potentially deadly</span>. No more touch-and-goes without clear awareness of surroundings. Passing low in front of launch is equally dangerous, as would be any blind intersection.
<br />- Wings of Rogallo donated $300 for the webcam.
<br />- Web ad policy is modified to forbid flashing ads and impose static images, with a 4-second minimum rotation if necessary.
<br />
<br />Pizza is mediocre. Meeting is adjourned</div>
