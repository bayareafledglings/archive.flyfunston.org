				<div class="content">The Club's  December  meeting was last  night.  there were two great horned owls  sitting beside the anemometer on the &quot;HOUSE   . huge and most  fortuitous.<br /> new Club  officers were elected,see the meeting minutes section.   thanks to the  outgoing officers for your  selfless service to the Club. <br />  The members in attendance  did letter  stuffing ...I mailed out  100  membership renewal forms/waivers  and voting members should receive them by snail mail  soon . (there is still a  20 hour minimum of  Funston  flying  per  year to  keep your   spot.)<br />Please  fill out and mail the forms  back to me.   (Two spacers  please remember to  pay for  both spots. )<br />this IS a busy   time of year  , but  Funston  flying figures  first.<br />When I get your  form , waivers, and  dues,  I'll  mail  you  your  key and a  2011 sticker too.<br />Please  include a  stamped  self addressed  envelope .<br />see you at the  fort, stay  safe  , have  fun , and  if  you must pound ,  make it to  the ice plant  carpet<br />Charlie</div>

				<div class="content">to The Proud Feathers,<br />below is the text that  I forgot to send  to the  voting  members this week.........another woops.....I may have to be   fired and given a Lara gold  retirement  parachute <br /><br /><span style="color: #8040FF">2011 Fellow Feathers Voting Membership and Sticker application. Please read!<br />Some critical events took place in 2009 that continue to affect the club. Conflicts with spectators and the failure to cooperate with the GGNRA / National Park Service law enforcement officers put our hang gliding permit in serious jeopardy. As a result, we (Fellow Feathers members) MUST be on our best behavior or risk losing our permit to fly at Fort Funston. There are two areas of prime importance:<br />1: All members are mandated to cooperate with rangers and other law enforcement officers.<br />2: There is a zero-tolerance position on the 25’ rule;<br />“No pilot may fly within 25' of any person on the ground. Pilots must yield to pedestrians and people on horseback. No pilot may launch when there are spectators in the launch area. Courtesy, especially toward spectators, is mandatory of all pilots.”<br />Remember that we are “Park Partners” and are being held to high standards. The FF rules state: “IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF EVERY PILOT TO KNOW, UPHOLD, AND ENFORCE THESE RULES”, so please take responsibility and step in to defuse any conflict you may be aware of.<br />GGNRA permit holders must pay a Service District Charge for the buildings they occupy. As a result, our clubhouse costs the club $2,734.48 per year. We must also carry property insurance, currently costing us $756.00 annually. In order to balance our budget, the annual dues for voting members is $65.00.<br />After submission of your application and assuming there is space in the clubhouse, you will receive your clubhouse key and helmet sticker in the same envelope! Please note that the clubhouse lock will be changed on February 1, 2011.<br />Send your completed forms, dues check, and a SASE (self addressed stamped envelope) to:<br />Charlie Nelson<br />3101 Page Street<br />Redwood City, CA 94063<br />Your membership dues not only pay our “rent” but are also put to good use maintaining the clubhouse, web cam, weather stations, hosting community events, and funding site improvements. Your generous donations help support hang gliding at Fort Funston and are greatly appreciated.<br />Thank you!<br />The Fellow Feathers Executive Committee</span></div>
