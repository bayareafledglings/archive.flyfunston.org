				<div class="content">Welcome to the Lake McClure Coyote Howl <br />May 14 &amp; 15, 2011. <br />Saturday May 14, 2011 <br />9am Speed Gliding competition. <br />11:00 am Pilot Meeting. Around Noon the Competition and Fun Flying begins. <br />4:00pm-7pm BBQ and beverages provided as pilots land. <br />The Rangers ask us to leave the landing zone area by dark. <br />FYI. Don’t leave your car parked in the LZ overnight or risk citation. <br /><br />Sunday May 15, 2011 <br />9am Speed Gliding <br />11:00 am Awards Ceremony hosted by Jay Bass <br />11:30-5:00 pm Competition and fun flying events. <br />Please clear out the “landing zone” area by dark. <br /><br /> If you have never been to Lake McClure, let us offer you a big welcome since this year’s Coyote Howl is the perfect chance. The popular Speed Gliding event will be held both days at 9 am. The cross country competition and spot landing contest begin around noon depending on conditions. <br />A mere $30 donation will allow entry to the competition, food and drinks, and provide MLSR with important fundraising. <br />Directions: <br />Take State Highway 132 east towards Coulterville. Go about 1/2 mile past the turnoff to Horseshoe Bend Recreation Area and look for the Landing Zone gate to your right. If you end up in Historic Coulterville, do not despair. Buy beer and drive back down to the west a couple miles and look for the LZ near the lake. The gate to the LZ should be accessible for the weekend. Pilots normally meet in the LZ, load up onto a 4WD and head to the locked launch gate. Please don’t hesitate to ask others (at the LZ) if you need a ride to launch or offer a ride if you have the room. <br /><br /><br />Camping. <br />There will no doubt be outbreaks of pilot camping complete with TIWTIWGTD stories around the camp fire this year at the Horseshoe Bend Campgrounds. <br />PLEASE NOTE:Access to the LZ and Launch is free, but If you enter the campsites, please pay the day use fee. The Rangers are sensitive about this so please show respect.. Thank you. <br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.lakemcclure.com/camping/horseshoe_bend.html">http://www.lakemcclure.com/camping/horseshoe_bend.html</a><!-- m --> <br />Some love the “no lights” camping areas of Horseshoe Bend Recreation Area Campground which have the feel of being in a remote area. <br /><br />Other The nearest gas stations on the way to McClure is the <br />Don Pedro Market <br />3317 State Highway 132, La Grange, CA 95329 <br />T-shirts will be available in the LZ for $20. <br />See you at Lake McClure on May 14 and 15. <br /><br /><br />Coulterville <br />The nearby town of Coulterville has a good restaurant and bar near the historic Hotel Jeffery.
