<br />o  Paid repackers would make the process go faster
<br />o  Need to find a different site since Jonas won’t be around
<br />• We may not be able to get as many people out for this as last time since it’s relatively soon afterwards.  Perhaps we could do one day only and make the other day available to other groups in the Bay Area.</div>
