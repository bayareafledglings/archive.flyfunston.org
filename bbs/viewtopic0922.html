<br />Tres. Report:  
<br />
<br />Atilla could not make the meeting so no report. 
<br />Pizza and drinks for the July meeting came to $27.46 
<br />
<br />Old Business
<br />
<br />World record disc throw attempt will be Monday 7-14-03. Hang gliding will be limited to south of launch during the event. George will post notices on web site, Fort Funston clubhouse and launch. 
<br />
<br />Kimo sent out new keys to clubhouse along with ID tags to be placed on gliders stored in the clubhouse.
<br />	
<br />New Business
<br />
<br />It was suggested that we contact Rick to see about upgrading the web site to do streaming video similar to Mission Ridge. George will contact Rick to see what’s involved… probably broadband and web page mods.
<br />
<br />$100 approved for purchase of two new wind socks. 
<br />
<br />Leifur gave a first report from the “rules and safety” committee. The committee was setup at a club meeting earlier in the year to review the current rules and use permit and recommend changes. Henry, Tim, Chris and Leifur are on the committee. In his report, Leifur gave a summary of accidents that have occurred in the last few years at Funston. He suggested that the club develop diagrams showing recommended launch and landing techniques for various wind conditions at Funston. The diagrams could be made available on the web site and would also be handed out with the site waivers. There was other discussion about the existing flying rules and it will be continued in future meetings.
<br />
<br />August meeting Tues 12th  8p.m. at the Fort Funston clubhouse</div>
