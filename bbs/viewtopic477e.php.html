Equipment not having proper identification will be considered abandoned and not authorized to be stored in the Clubhouse and shall become the property of the Club and may be sold at auction with the proceeds going to the Club. 
<br />
<br />6. All equipment left in the Clubhouse and not removed within 30 days after the expiration of the membership or loss of the privilege to store equipment in the Clubhouse will be considered a donation and shall become the property of the Club and may be sold at auction with the proceeds going to the Club. 
<br />

<br />
<br />13. Each Member shall indemnify and hold harmless the Club, its officers and members, and the GGNRA, its officers and employees, against all claims, actions or proceedings, costs, damages and liabilities connected in any manner with the member’s use of the Clubhouse.

				<div class="content">Either Charlie or myself can make you a new tag. An easy and better alternative is to put your own name on the glider bag. A strip of Dacron attached to the zipper, ala MSC, works very well. Please email with your choice.</div>
