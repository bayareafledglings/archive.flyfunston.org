<br />
<br />
<br />What's with the heavy equipment? The Army Corps of Engineers is removing underground fuel tanks. You may remember this was done at Fort Funston in the ‘90s – but new technology has allowed them to identify more tanks so they are back to finish the work. The work is expected to last about four weeks and is currently planned to begin September 14th  and end the second week of October. The schedule may change slightly due to differing site conditions that may be discovered in the field.
<br />
<br />TEMPORARY ROAD CLOSURES: The Corps project will require a short term closure, September 21-24,  of the roadway leading to the buildings in the southern portion of Fort Funston. The Corps has agreed to ensure emergency vehicles may still utilize road if necessary. See this map that shows the section of roadway that will be affected. In addition to that short term closure, investigation at sites in the north part of the park may require very brief (less than three hours) and minor re-routes just around the drilling equipment, if necessary at all. 
<br />
<br />UPCOMING CONSTRUCTION: Daly City and the City and County of San Francisco have storm and sewer outfall projects that will require work at the Fort Funston site scheduled to begin the end of September. We’ll send more details about these projects as we receive them.
<br />
<br />PARKING LOT IMPACT: The Presidents Cup golf tournament, hosted by the Harding Park Golf Course, is scheduled from October 6-11 and GGNRA will be providing 50 spaces at Fort Funston for vehicles displaying ADA placards.
<br />
<br />We’ll post construction updates to <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.fortfunstondog.org/">www.fortfunstondog.org</a><!-- w --> – and don’t forget our monthly cleanup on Saturday, October 3rd at 9:30.</div>
