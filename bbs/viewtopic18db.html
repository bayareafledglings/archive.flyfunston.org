				<div class="content">.<br />There continue to be issues involving unqualified pilots landing on the chips.<br /><br />There was talk about a FF chip landing sign-off, but that is too subjective and too complicated to implement and enforce.<br /><br />How about we simply make a rule that says &quot;Only Advanced (H-4) rated pilots are allowed to land on the west side of the Sand Trail.&quot; ?</div>

				<div class="content">Steve,<br /><br />One of the problems with this proposal is there are many &quot;Advanced (H-4)&quot; pilots that are not qualified to land on the chips, as well.<br /><br />This needs to be discussed at the upcoming meeting, though, and I'm sure there is language in our existing-all-too-often-changed rules that addresses such an issue.<br /><br />Chris</div>

				<div class="content">True, there are H-4's that should not be landing on the chips and there are some H-3's that have all the skill and judgement to land there safely. This includes avoiding spectators and pedestrians on the Sand Trail. Not sure what the answer is but we need to do something if we want to preserve the site!</div>

				<div class="content">I presume that I'm the cause of this discussion.<br /><br />Yes, I should have gone around again.<br />Yes, I should have gone farther back before turning.<br />Yes, I should have flown straighter off the edge.<br />Yes, I should have corrected better.<br /><br />I should have been farther back before turning, but, in addition, I was higher than I realized,<br />and the air at that point was more floaty than last time I was there.<br /><br />When I was approaching, and realized I wasn't going to make it down behind the walkway, <br />there was someone on the path that didn't seem to me to be moving.<br />In my attempt to avoid her, I think I went more toward the bushes,<br />and at the same time was desperately trying to lose altitude.<br />After that, I was pretty much in disaster avoidance mode.<br /><br />While I was flying that day, I thought that next time, I should do several practice approaches, landings, and launches.<br />Seems that I was just one time to long in that desire.<br /><br />It may well be that, if there are any changes to be made at Funston, when pilots first fly there,<br />particularly newer pilots, they should do several practice approaches, then landings and launches.<br />There was one other first timer that landed way back near the clubhouse.<br />Clearly my crash caused more consternation, however, neither of us did at all well.<br />I think that he wasn't all that far from the access road.<br /><br />Not trying to diminish my mistakes, just be helpful.<br />I really would like to fly quite a bit at Funston.  Safely.</div>

				<div class="content">I think restricting yourself to flying on days that are more straight in, would be good for a while. Flying when the rotor is mostly to the north of the landing area will give you more-rotor free-room in the landing area. The rotor expands as it goes down wind, so care needs to be taken with approaches too. Learn how changes in direction affect the rotor's position. Visualize it and avoid it.</div>

				<div class="content">The club has had this kind of problem in the past. Here's how it's been addressed:<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../primer.html">http://flyfunston.org/primer.php.html</a><!-- m --><br />You know how it is with aviation. It starts out simple but gets kind of complicated.<br />Kent Harker put some good thought into writing this Primer.<br />It should be required reading before new threes tackle Funston.<br />Check it out,<br />-Chuck</div>
