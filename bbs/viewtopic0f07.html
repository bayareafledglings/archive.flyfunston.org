				<div class="content">I'd like to suggest some new utilties for Club Members. Taking a cue from Tim's generous help over the holidays in getting some tools we now have for working on the wind sock, I propose we add some tools and commonly used spare parts to an inventory we keep in the clubhouse. I have several downtubes I will donate to get things started. <br /><br />Proposed list of spare parts:<br />Downtubes for most common gliders, faired and round<br />Tip wands<br />Batten string (various sizes)<br />Batten snap fixtures<br />Common bolts and nuts<br /><br />Tools:<br />Wrenches<br />Screwdrivers<br />Pliers<br />Portable drill and drill bits<br /><br />All together I'm thinking about $500 worth of parts and tools.<br />When a member uses a part, he will order and replace as soon as possible. If they don't do it by the end of the year, we add the cost on to his club house renewal.<br />Full disclosure - I had been borrowing a tip wand from Dave for like 6 months - my bad for not replacing it sooner, though only used once. <br />If other members have parts they could donate, so much the better.<br /><br />Accidents happen and some basic maintenance items like batten string replacement should be done more frequently. Getting replacement parts can take weeks, and for most pilots who don't have a second glider, they're out of commission for that time. Many of us do keep spares but don't usually keep them with us (I don't drag my downtubes around - only on flying trips to the mountains).<br />I'd rather offer these spare parts so anywone can use them and get back in the air same day if they want to.</div>
