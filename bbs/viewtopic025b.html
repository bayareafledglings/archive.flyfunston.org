				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>Steve Urbach wrote:</cite>Am I understanding this correctly?<br />As a Lifetime member of the USHPA and a former FF Club Officer, I can no longer participate on this forum because I can't Fly anymore?</div></blockquote><br />That's what it looks like Steve. While <span style="font-weight: bold">crvalley</span> talks mumbo jumbo about his man cave, your club is being undermined by USHPA and their new PG President (Rich Hass). That's the information that's really being suppressed. Here are a few of the SOP &quot;gems&quot; passed by USHPA at the fall 2010 Board meeting (I know this isn't fun to read, but this is what they're doing):<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>USHPA SOP 06-01.04 Organizational Requirements wrote:</cite>C. Chapters are required to allow membership by all USHPA-rated pilots who are also qualified to fly at Chapter-controlled sites, without restrictions. All Chapter members must have full voting privileges.<br /><br />F. Chapters and its officers are required to be goodwill ambassadors for USHPA and are expected to work within the USHPA committee system to support USHPA’s image and support USHPA programs. Chapters cannot on one hand participate in USHPA subsidized programs and on the other take actions which are detrimental to the USHPA and the sport. Examples of actions which may be detrimental are:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: 90%; line-height: 116%;">1. Any correspondence in any public media which is critical of USHPA’s programs and policies.<br />2. Any correspondence in any public media which is critical of other Chapters.<br />3. Any Club policy which is detrimental or causes harm to any USHPA program.</span><br /><br />G. Chapters may not, as a matter of policy, negligently or willfully discriminate against pilots of one glider type, either hang glider or paraglider, or discriminate between pilots of equal pilot rating. Chapters must ensure that recreational flight privileges are made available to any and all qualified USHPA members meeting Chapter site requirements in a fair and equitable manner without discrimination. Note: This requirement does not indicate that a site cannot be hang gliding only or paragliding only. Glider specific sites are permissible for safety, land owner, and possibly other conditions.</div></blockquote><br />Now they did get some &quot;push back&quot; on some of these issues from the membership, and some of them have been retracted. But the fact that they were passed in the first place tips their hand as to what they would like to slip through in the future (maybe when <span style="font-weight: bold">crvalley</span> and his &quot;tribe&quot; are sleeping it off in their man cave).<br /><br />But don't speak out about these problems, because that's embarrassing to some folks. Heaven forbid that anyone be embarrassed. It's much more important to sit silently while <span style="font-weight: bold">crvalley</span> plays with his spears ... and USHPA gives us the shaft.<br /><br />Bob Kuczewski<br />858-204-7499 ... call any time.</div>

In one of my prev posts I wrote:  &quot;In addition I'd like to see public forums where newbie’s can ask questions about getting started at Funston, list contact info for club officers and mentors, where members can post photos and videos, and of course an official announcement board for club events and notices, and a location for club minutes. I believe that the Board is on-board with this train of thought.&quot;<br /><br />I think the &quot;Announcement&quot; forum would cover your concerns because club officers could post something for you. I would for instance, continue to submit notices of upcoming HAM exams and plans for the Funston Air Races. Someone from Hat Creek could submit items related to their site, like launch or landing issues, etc.<br /><br />I believe that more ideas from more pilots will help the Board refine their lists. Someone might even suggest a completely different approach altogether. I'd like to hear any ideas that would serve the club and our flying community while at the same time maintain our upstanding image.</div>

If you don't know everything I've communicated to them, then how do you know that some of my efforts haven't been influential (whether they'll admit that or not)? Remember that the <span style="font-weight: bold"><a href="http://torreyhawks.org/" class="postlink">Torrey Hawks <span style="text-decoration: underline">Hang Gliding</span> Club</a></span> was affected just as much as your club was. We were vulnerable on the voting issue and the gag order as well. Don't you think we might have been lobbying to fix that? Do you think that just because you don't know what someone else has done, that means they've done nothing?<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>flyin_canuck wrote:</cite>Do hang gliding a favor a go away</div></blockquote><br />I've already done hang gliding a big favor by bringing some of these issues to light. If that pisses people off, then that's on them. If you want me to go away, then work to fix some of these problems rather than sweeping them under the carpet. You can start with open voting by the USHPA Board so all members can see how their Directors are voting. Every Director's voting record should be available to all members just as they are with Congress. That would make them think twice before passing garbage like this.<br /><br />Thanks in advance for your efforts on open voting. Please keep us posted on your progress.<br /><br />Bob Kuczewski</div>

Can you help me with some examples on this forum that you feel are tarnishing your club's image? I'm not saying it's not true, but I think some concrete examples might help me see the problem better. Thanks.<br /><br />Also, if you're worried about your club's image, you might use some of the more advanced features of.php.htmlBB. You can, for example, use groups and ranks to designate forum members as club members and non-club members. These can be displayed on each post. So anyone looking at the forum will know whether &quot;disreputable&quot; posts were from your club members or not. That can be done while still allowing interaction between members and non-members on your forum.<br /><br />But back to my main question, please let me know what you've seen on this forum that you think is inappropriate. Maybe a concrete example will help.<br /><br />Thanks.<br />Bob Kuczewski</div>

Did I explain that clearly enough or not? If not, then please ask what you don't understand about that explanation. Thanks.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>thermal pirate wrote:</cite>Just look how well FF does with the GGNRA and how bad your Hawks do at Torrey. That may sting, but something about what the FF are doing works, and all without your precious input.<br />You asked for it so there you go.</div></blockquote><br />Our Hawks are doing great at Torrey. We don't get any credit in some circles, but the people who really know what's going on recognize that we've been the force behind many of the positive changes there. Hang gliding is in the minority at Torrey, and so we're fighting an uphill battle (something you've not yet experienced at Funston). But if you want to know what I've done (with the help of the <a href="http://torreyhawks.org/" class="postlink">Torrey Hawks</a>), I'll give you a list:<br /><br />1. Got Dave Beardslee reinstated at Torrey after Jebb had banned him for life.<br />2. Got the Torrey Pines Soaring Council meeting again in 2007.<br />3. Got David Jebb's son Gabe recognized as having a conflict of interest on the Soaring Council.<br />4. Got David Jebb's choice for the Council (Doug Poirier) replaced.<br />5. Eventually got Brad Hall replaced on the Council by Ken Baier.<br />6. Removed David Jebb as Regional Director in Region 3 by defeating him with more votes than any other Director in that entire election.<br />7. Highly likely responsible for David Jebb leaving Torrey (he disappeared within days of losing the election).<br />8. Held monthly Torrey Hawks fly-ins for over 2 years demonstrating a continued hang gliding presence at that important site.<br />9. Brought together a large number of hang glider pilots (many who don't even like each other) for a common cause at Torrey.<br /><br />Those are off the top of my head, and I'll stop before I have to use 2 digits to number them.<br /><br />Look, if I had been ineffective, there wouldn't be so many people (like yourself) throwing stones at me. I've rattled the cages at the top, and that's why there are so many people bad-mouthing me. I put forth the Accountability Amendment because I was willing to stand behind my votes on the USHPA Board. No other Director - including Urs - has done that to this day.<br /><br />Don't feel sorry that you asked me for that. I'm proud to stand on my record. Thanks for the opportunity to do so.  <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.html" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /></div>

If people are interested in hearing more about your club, or your issues with the USHPA, they will go to your site.  If lots of people join your forum, good for you.  If people are not going to your site/forum, that should be an indication to you that they are not interested.<br /><br />Either way, you've made your point(s), and I see no reason for you to continue to use our forum as a soapbox for your agenda.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Brian (zippidy),<br /><br />I wish it were so simple. For example, how many people on this forum know Urs' voting record at USHPA? Does Urs publish it anywhere? What about the other twenty-some Directors? Does anyone know how they vote? Why isn't there a record showing each issue and how each of the Directors has voted?<br /><br />Yet every year, the members are asked to &quot;elect&quot; Directors to run the club. How can members elect Directors without knowing how the Directors are voting for the members?  This is the basis of all representative government, and USHPA has violated it.<br /><br />I've come onto this forum to help build a better system - either within USHPA or outside of it. There are people who support that and people who oppose it. Why should the people who oppose it be able to silence those who support it? Given that USHPA is increasingly imposing its will on pilots, instructors, Chapters, and sites, it seems prudent to have these discussions anywhere there are pilots willing to listen. I think there are a few pilots at this site who are interested in the topic, and I don't see why they can't discuss it in this forum.<br /><br />Sunshine, Brian. That's what we need.<br /><br />Thanks for your time.<br />Bob Kuczewski</div>

You're being a nudnik, and it's cluttering the forum.<br /><br />I agree with Zippidy - you made your point.  I also happen to agree with the notion of having votes be on record, but your approach is past reasoned argument and into being a pest.   This topic is &quot;sucking the air out of the room&quot; to the detriment of other, ongoing conversations.  And lord knows there are enough of those happening right now too.  That's what we're objecting to here.  <br /><br />Just to get the point across numerically, I went through your posts and picked out those with variations on the &quot;USHPA doesn't tell members how people voted&quot; theme.

You're being a nudnik, and it's cluttering the forum.</div></blockquote><br />I didn't know there was a requirement for anyone to read the entire forum. Forums are like a buffet. If I can find the roast beef that I like, why should I care if they're serving sushi on the next aisle? It's not about cluttering the forum. It's about people (like me) saying things that other people (like you) don't want to have said. Can we at least be that honest about the discussion?<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Daniel Pifko wrote:</cite>I also happen to agree with the notion of having votes be on record</div></blockquote><br />Then why haven't you joined me in requesting that of our Directors?  ... &lt;crickets&gt;<br /><br />It's interesting that you took the time to count how many times I've mentioned the voting issue, but you wouldn't take the time to post something like this:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hi Urs,<br />You're our Regional Director, and we should know how you vote. Can you please report that to this forum? Also, would you please propose some kind of USHPA SOP or bylaw change so all members can see how their Directors are voting?<br />Thanks,<br />Your loyal supporter,<br />Daniel Pifko</div></blockquote><br />or something like this:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hi Dave Wills,<br />You're our Regional Director, USHPA VP, and Organization and Bylaws Chairman. I've heard that Bob Kuczewski proposed a bylaws amendment in your O&amp;B committee that would have helped members find out how their Directors have voted. I also heard that he sent you several requests to get this on the agenda of your committee and you refused. When he brought it up at the committee meeting you refused to even allow the discussion. I think it's important for members to know how their Directors are voting, and I'm asking you to propose an SOP change or a bylaw change to implement that.<br />Thanks,<br />Your loyal supporter,<br />Daniel Pifko</div></blockquote><br />Until I see that kind of action (and appropriate follow up), I know that my work here isn't done.   <img src="images/smilies/icon_biggrin.html" alt=":D" title="Very Happy" /><br /><br />P.S. It's important to note that Dave Wills won by only a single vote. It's unfortunate that I wasn't on this forum during that election, or I might have revealed some of the other things that Dave Wills has done. That might have given us a different Regional Director and a different USHPA Vice President. You see, the stakes are much higher than one local club. They affect all of USHPA, and that's why it's important for this information to get to <span style="text-decoration: underline">ALL</span> members in <span style="text-decoration: underline">ALL</span> clubs. That's why I'm here, and that's also why I've structured the <a href="http://ushawks.org/" class="postlink">US Hawks</a> as a single forum that integrates national discussions with local Chapter discussions. We're all pilots and we're going to need better communication if we want a better national association. And that brings me back on topic. Banning non-members from this forum would rob your own members of important information that might help them cast better votes. Why would your club want to do that? Why Daniel? Why Steve? Why?</div>

I just don't want you to say what you're saying so much, especially since it interferes with what I actually do say you should be saying to get things done.  <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Then why haven't you joined me in requesting that of our Directors?  ... &lt;crickets&gt;</div></blockquote><br /><br />Because I have shit to do and have chosen to contribute to the betterment of the world in other ways with my limited volunteer time (which you're using up, by the way.  And I may charge you a beer for the flak I'm getting from the fam for writing this while on vacation).  I also think asthma, tuberculosis and malaria should be cured. <br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div>It's interesting that you took the time to count how many times I've mentioned the voting issue, but you wouldn't take the time to post something like this:<br /><br /><blockquote class="uncited"><div><blockquote class="uncited"><div>Hi Urs,<br />You're our Regional Director, and we should know how you vote.

I believe in openness (e.g. publishing the clubhouse waiting list online) but think that public shaming is both self-aggrandizing and self-defeating.  This is also a repeated flaw in your debating style - you assume I haven't done something because I haven't published it.  Maybe I threatened Urs with an overheated flask of sake, demanding he implement a sunshine clause or face a lifetime of Japanese-cuisine-induced disfigurement.  Could have happened.</div>

				<div class="content">Hi Daniel,<br /><br />For a guy without much time, you seem to be spending it in an odd way.<br /><br />Rather than asking Urs Kellenberger and Dave Wills to open up USHPA voting (which would take very little time to do), you're spending lots of time debating far less important issues with me.<br /><br />Which is more important ... open voting by the USHPA board or how many posts I tack onto a flyfunston topic?<br /><br />Now you did dangle the possibility that you've done that in private. If that's more than a tease, I'd be interested to see the results. But until there are some results, please don't expect people who care about open governance to sit on their hands.<br /><br />Bob K.</div>
