				<div class="content">Thank you again for your kind welcome and support of my 16mm short film project at your November meeting.   
<br /> 
<br />I'm writing to let you know that the film is 99% ready and will be premiering this Tuesday, December 7th at Stanford University (see details below).  As I mentioned at the meeting, this short film is a portrait of WOR member, Harold Johnson, and the way he enjoys hang gliding at this stage of his life. 
<br /> 
<br />There will be 7 other shorts at this festival (see program below), of many interesting and diverse topics---even a little nudity in one of them!  The event is free and open to the public, and all WOR members, friends, and families are encouraged to attend.   
<br /> 
<br />Please feel free to write or call with any questions. 
<br /> 
<br />Thanks again for your support !!!

<br />Short Reception Will Follow 
<br /> 
<br />About the Films: 
<br /> 
<br />Low Art-- by Ben Wu 
<br />Low Art is a portrait of Bobby Laguna, a 19 year old artist from West San Jose. The film examines his thoughts and motivations in working with his 
<br />chosen medium, the lowrider bicycle. 
<br /> 
<br />Stanford Banned-- by Revere Lanoue 
<br />A look at the relationship between Stanford University and its controversial "marching" band. 
<br /> 
<br />Green Cross-- by Ashley Tindall 
<br />In this film, the owner of one of San Francisco's cannabis dispensaries lets us into his club and describes his legal battles and his personal 
<br />commitment to fighting for patients' safe access to medicinal marijuana. 
<br /> 
<br />Rotation-- by Erin Hudson 
<br />As suburban development encroaches upon the rural hills of the California Bay Area, farmers Marianne and Gordon Griffith reflect on the changing landscape they call home.  Rotation explores this couples' resilient relationship to the land and to the wind. 
<br /> 
<br />Decent Exposure--  by Jasmin Gordon 
<br />An intimate portrait of the experience of being a nude art model. 
<br /> 
<br />Jumping Off Mountains-- by Nick Davila 
<br />Few people dare to hang glide, and even fewer in their late 60's.  Here is a portrait of a retired man named Harold who has learned how to fly. 
<br /> 
<br />Old Soles-- by Leigh Iacobucci 
<br />A portrait of Carlos Lopez, a 70 year old cobbler from El Salvador, and his unique shoe repair shop on Haight Street. 
<br /> 
<br />Still Standing-- by Kathy Huang 
<br />When one of San Francisco's finest human statues decides to speak up, he reveals some surprising secrets about his job and personal life.
