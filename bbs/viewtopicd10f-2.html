				<div class="content">The GGNRA is developing long term plans that MIGHT infringe on our set-up area behind the &quot;bush&quot;. (what is described as the &quot;small grove of trees and shrubs&quot;. <br /><br />Their plans have good intent, being to provide handicap access and picnic seating. BUT, they don't realize how critical the area behind the bush is to our sport. PERHAPS the planned picnic area will be out of the way and not bother us, but we need to find out! <br /><br />We need to see their plans and tell them if they will have negative impact on hang gliding. <br /><br />PLEASE, attend the public meeting on Tuesday, November 9, and give you feedback. Please request that they leave the HG set-up area as-is, and construct any new picnic area on the NORTH side of the boardwalk. We also need to make sure the new boardwalk is built to the north, and not south into our set-up area. <br /><br />You can find the meeting announcement here, including a link to the entire document: <br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/public_meeting_access.htm">http://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/p ... access.htm</a><!-- m --> <br /><br />The following excerpt describes the improvements that MIGHT impact us: <br /><br />&quot;REQUEST FOR PUBLIC COMMENT <br /><br />Proposed Accessibility Improvements at Golden Gate National Recreation Area. <br /><br />FORT FUNSTON <br /><br />6.	Hang Glider Deck (long-term) <br />The existing wood boardwalk to the hang glider deck provides access from the north parking lot to the viewing area overlooking the shore. The structure is constructed over an original Nike Missile site with the concrete base end stations protruding through the viewing deck floor. The observation deck and accessible route to it will be redesigned with minimum impact to the concrete missile site underneath, and will include integrated wheelchair seating locations for observation of the hang glider programs and access to the scenic vista. Benches with back supports, arm rests and adjacent clear ground space for shoulder to shoulder wheelchair seating will be provided. <br /><br />To the south of the boardwalk, there are two benches and one picnic table provided, none of which are on an accessible route. Constructing the new boardwalk will provide an opportunity to widen the area near the beginning of the route to include an accessible picnic area and sitting area that is sheltered from the wind by the small grove of trees and shrubs.&quot;</div>

				<div class="content">It appears that the proposed accessibility improvements WILL encroach into our setup area.<br /><br />ALL FUNSTON PILOTS (that would be you!) need to make comments to the GGNRA and let them know the proposed improvements would have a negative impact on our established use, but an alternative design would fulfill accessibility requirements while preserving our usage.<br /><br />Click on &quot;email us&quot; at the bottom of the page below &quot;Summary Documents&quot; to make your comment:  <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/public_meeting_access.htm">http://www.nps.gov/goga/planyourvisit/p ... access.htm</a><!-- m -->  <br /><br /><br />Here are some GGNRA guidelines for making a public comment:<br /><br />&quot;The primary goal of scoping for a project is to determine the range of issues and<br />alternatives to be addressed. At the time of scoping, the park provides a<br />description of the project proposal, including a statement of the purpose of and<br />need for the project and a list of project goals. The public is asked to submit<br />comments, concerns, and suggestions relating to these goals.<br />Public comments made during scoping directly inform draft plans. Park staff<br />continually review your comments as they work to define the scope of what the<br />plan will cover and to develop alternatives to address the issues. The most<br />useful types of scoping comments consider the following:<br /><br />-	Alternative approaches and ideas for accomplishing project goals<br /><br />-	The range of environmental and socioeconomic issues that need to be<br />considered<br /><br />-	Other potential projects that might affect or be affected by this project<br /><br />-	Information that needs to be considered (such as related research) and why<br /><br />-	Information on how you use the park and how a project might affect that use<br />And answer these types of questions:<br /><br />-	What do you love about the Golden Gate National Recreation Area?<br /><br />-	What do you do while you are there?<br /><br />-	What would you like to see protected?<br /><br />-	What kind of services or facilities would you like to see offered, improved, or<br />removed?</div>

				<div class="content">It was talked about some at the last meeting but....<br />Should we start adding wood chips on that other side of the walkway to make it accessible??...(for tables).<br /><br />Diev<br /><br />(on a somewhat related note.....the &quot;Entering Hang Gliding...&quot; sign (on the left) at the top of the stairs to the beach is about to be covered in chips, needs to get pulled out-moved down further....it was too late yesterday when I noticed to do it)</div>

				<div class="content">I don't think that covering the ice plant with a layer of wood chips would create a very good foundation for anything. The ice plant is pretty deep and it would take way too long for it to die and decompose.<br /><br />The ice plant should be removed before chip spreading for the area to resemble our setup area. That removal would take more manual labor than I can muster!<br /><br />I recommend that we wait until we hear back from the GGNRA. They can bring in a piece of equipment that could do the job right in no time.<br /><br /><br />Yes, please move the &quot;Entering HG area&quot; sign to keep it visible but out of the way. Thanks!!!</div>
