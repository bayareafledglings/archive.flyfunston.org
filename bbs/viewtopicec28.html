				<div class="content">This news just in, machinery might create an obstacle on the beach:
<br />
<br />Daly City's force main outfall pipe - carrying 6 million gallons of treated sewage per day - coming out of the bluff at Ft. Funston has been severely compromised by the winter storms and they feel it will break if an immediate fix is not done. A pipe break would mean treated sewage would occur on the beach. They propose a fix on Wednesday, April 28.
<br />
<br />Emergency Repair Description:  Repair damaged section of 33” submarine outfall line located on Fort Funston beach. Two pieces of heavy equipment (Excavator and bulldozer) are required to complete the repairs.  The repair will be done by removing a section temporarily and inserting new liner.
<br />Pipe will be put back to existing configuration. Crews and equipment will enter and leave the beach from Avalon Canyon -2.25 miles south of the outfall line - in Daly City and work will be done during low tide.  Crews and equipment will remain on the beach.</div>
