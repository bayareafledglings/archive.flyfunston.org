I talk to the operations manager and let them know what are plans are and the dates we plan on being out there. We are allowed to car-camp but there are no facilities....There are hotels near by in Tracy.<br /><br />I would think it would be a weekend in the next few months with a backup weekend the following...but it could be as far off as the middle of Feb...<br /><br />Spread the word....<br /><br />Diev</div>
