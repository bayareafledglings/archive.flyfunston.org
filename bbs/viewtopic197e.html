				<h3>Meeting Minutes 10-11-2011</h3>
				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Wed Oct 12, 2011 9:57 am</strong></div>
				<div class="author">by <strong>fakeDecoy</strong></div>
				<div class="content">Attendees: Tom R, Ted, Larry C, Jim M, Rafi L, Tim W, Ben D, John S, Chuck K, Steve R, Van P, Dave K<br /><br />Notable flights: Blue shear a couple weeks ago, 2000' top of lift.<br /><br />Van made motion for club to donate $200 to Film Fest. Seconded. Vote passed, 6-3.<br /><br />Discussion of H2s soaring. Several instructors have violated the rules with their H2 students. Where and when H2s should be allowed to soar, or if they should be allowed to soar at all. The role of mentors in deciding whether the conditions are appropriate for a H2 soaring. The history of H2s flying Funston and Westlake. Instructors violating rules are subject to suspension of flying and teaching privileges. No change to existing H2 rules. <br /><br />Tom mentioned two unknown H2s appeared at the site, amidst other pilots, and launched without anyone noticing and reacting soon enough to stop them.<br /><br />Someone raised a question about what to do if a pilot ignores a suspension order by an officer and flies anyway. General agreement that the ranger/police can be called and informed that the person launched illegally, with their flying privilege under the use permit having been suspended.<br /><br />Steve is ordering helmet stickers for 2012.<br /><br />Discussion of site intro points that mentors and sticker holders need to cover. A list is already on the website. No change. Opinions expressed include pilots taking their first flight at Funston should not be doing 270+ degree approaches, pilots need to have the bowl pointed out to them in order to follow Westlake protocol, a list of points should be on the membership form, a list should be instead somewhere in the setup area, and a list should instead be left on the website. No change to list. List left on website. Mentor list on website updated.</div>
