<br />
<br />Treasurer’s Report
<br />
<br />$1275 deposited
<br />$79.95 expenses
<br />
<br />About $5100 balance
<br />
<br />Old Items:
<br />
<br />•	Clubhouse
<br />o	Keys mailed a week ago.  Lock on door changed.  Changed the whole lock, not just rekeyed.  
<br />o	The lock doesn’t stick
<br />o	Jonas tried all 100 keys himself
<br />o	7 people from the clubhouse haven’t paid 2005 dues
<br />o	Jonas is out of the picture at the beginning of September due to honeymoon.  We need to plan for the transition. 
<br />o	We need to identify and label all of the gliders in purgatory before we forget which one is which.
<br />o	Could we put together a stock of gliders for visiting pilots? Other places do this.  Would our waiver take care of this? Could we put an addendum on the glider?  We could sell a glider to a pilot for a minor amount and buy it back afterwards.  Would the club need to maintain the gliders? Fix them after they’re whacked.  They could make a donation to the clubhouse so they can fly. This idea is tabled for now.
<br />o	Expense: $196.46
<br />
<br />•	No Parking signs
<br />o	Steve did the white lines.  They are working.  People are parking in the spots. 
<br />o	Daniel spoke to the rangers so that nobody will get tickets.  
<br />
<br />•	Wood chips
<br />o	We got a couple of loads and have distributed
<br />o	We need more. More trucks worth.  
<br />
<br />New Items:
<br />
<br />•	Suspensions
<br />o	Eric Brainard and Ward Carter
<br />o	Diev Hart
<br />o	Perhaps next year we should remind people that everyone is responsible for keeping the site open.  
<br />
<br />•	Waivers for non-pilots
<br />o	Do we have a liability because RC pilots have signed waivers and are out on launch?
<br />o	
<br />
<br />•	Camera and computers 
<br />o	Rick fixed it
<br />o	We have a new computer as backup
<br />
<br />•	Urs payment
<br />o	approved
<br />•	Daniel: receipt for photocopying
<br />•	Steve: receipt for shovels and pitchforks</div>
