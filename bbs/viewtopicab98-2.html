				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Thu Dec 23, 2010 2:51 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">On the Fellow Feathers’ Permit and Voting membership form below the signature line is a new rule that should be w/drawn or revised. The rule states: “This member stipulates that for purpose of notice, official notification shall be placed in the Fellow Feathers clubhouse ….”<br /><br />Our bylaws state notice of meetings and bylaw changes shall be posted on the clubhouse door. The bylaws are silent on notice for other matters. Under the new rule a pilot could be given notice that he is being summoned to a disciplinary meeting to have his flying privileges revoked by a posting inside the clubhouse even if the pilot doesn’t have access to the clubhouse. Pilots w/access to the clubhouse who fly infrequently may not have the opportunity to see notices posted inside the building.<br /><br />I am sure Charley wouldn’t do this but a glider could be removed from the clubhouse w/o the courtesy of an e-mail or letter to pilot. Only a posting inside the building.<br /><br />Club rules should be made by club members and voted upon at meetings. I recommend the following notice rule: “Notice of disciplinary proceedings and removal of gliders from the clubhouse shall be by e-mail or regular mail sent to the pilot's last known address.&quot;<br /> <br /> Rules may be passed by a simple majority at a club meeting.<br /> <br />Dan Brown</div>

				<div class="content">I don’t have a problem with spelling out how the club contacts members in regard to disciplinary actions and clubhouse management. Even though the club has been handling this fine for decades, it can’t hurt to have procedures in writing.<br /><br />But just to clarify: The one line notice to which you are referring is not a new rule. It has been in place since we incorporated as a non-profit and is a legal requirement for corporations.<br /><br />To reiterate what I said in our private email: This statement has nothing to do with disciplinary actions or clubhouse management. It is a legal requirement for non-profit corporations to inform its voting members how they will be notified of official business meetings.<br /><br />By having this statement on the membership form, the corporation is relieved of its duty to mail a letter to each voting member whenever there is a proposed bylaws change. The club has been using the clubhouse door for notices of proposed bylaws changes since its early days and as I recall, you lobbied very hard to keep it that way. This notice is in line with your wishes!<br /><br />The language for club disciplinary actions and clubhouse management that appears in the FF rules and Bylaws has not changed for many years. And you are right, they don’t specify how members should be notified of important issues like suspensions or glider auctions. If you think these documents need revision, please feel free to make a motion to change them. Just understand that this has nothing to do with the one line notice on the membership form.</div>

				<div class="content">Not to prolong the discussion since there appears to be basic agreement but posting on the door for meetings and bylaw changes has been the procedure since 2000 when I wrote the previous set of  bylaws.<br /><br />  Despite the new rule, bylaw changes and notice of meetings still must be posted on the door. According to the new rule, all other notices must be posted inside the clubhouse and many pilots never go inside the clubhouse or go there infrequently. Also since the new rule was not passed by the members at a meeting, it is unenforceable.</div>

				<div class="content">I want to point out that we are talking about “apples and oranges” in that one type of notice applies to all Voting Members in regard to corporate business, and the other notice is for an individual in regard to a suspension or clubhouse eviction that only affects them. These are two different types of notices and need to be handled differently.<br /><br />&quot;Purpose of notice&quot; is a term from corporate law. The Fellow Feathers non-profit corporation is by law, required to inform Voting Members how they will be notified of BOD meetings and opportunities to vote.<br /><br />The statement currently reads &quot;This member stipulates by signature that for purpose of notice, official notifications shall be posted in the Fellow Feathers clubhouse, Building FF-206, Fort Funston, San Francisco, CA.&quot;<br /><br />I agree that this statement should not be in conflict with the bylaws so I propose that we change the word &quot;in&quot; to &quot;on&quot;.<br /><br />It would then read:<br /><br />&quot;This member stipulates by signature that for purpose of notice, official notifications shall be posted on the Fellow Feathers clubhouse, Building FF-206, Fort Funston, San Francisco, CA.&quot;<br /><br />As for your proposal to have our rules specify how individual FF members, both voting and non-voting, will be notified of disciplinary actions and clubhouse evictions:<br /><br />“Notice of disciplinary proceedings and removal of gliders from the clubhouse shall be by e-mail or regular mail sent to the pilot's last known address.&quot;<br /><br />Question: Would this best appear in the FF rules or the bylaws?<br /><br />Thanks for your help in getting our documents right!</div>

				<div class="content">Both notices, the stipulation beneath the signature line and the Bylaws/Disciplinary, should be submitted to the members for simple majority vote at a regular meeting. There is no need to go through the complicated Bylaw procedure. <br /><br />I suggest we include the term &quot;reasonable&quot; in the notices. For example: &quot;Reasonable notice shall be given ... .&quot;<br /><br />The problem w/making rules by stipulation is that it prevents a full discussion of the rules and deprives members of a voice in rule making. The only reason I became aware of this matter is that a pilot contacted me about the stipulation. He is a club member w/o access to the Clubhouse.</div>

The Fellow Feathers of Fort Funston Hang Gliding Club and its Voting Members must comply with California corporate law. Voting members must comply with FF rules and bylaws. Posting on the clubhouse door is FF SOP. Comply or don't fly, simple as that.<br /><br />Please bring your concerns to the next meeting.

				<div class="content">Before the discussion further deteriorates, it should be noted that the Club doesn't have SOPs or a notice rule. (See rules pulbished on WEB site.) The Bylaws  have a notice requirement for meetings and Bylaw changes but are silent on notice for other matters.<br /><br />The Club needs to have a notice requirement for other matters and that is why I made the above recommendations. The recommendations are not limited to changing &quot;in&quot; to &quot;on&quot;. Perhaps better notice than posting on the clubhouse would be posting on the WEB site. However notice is to be provided, it should be decided by the members and not by a stipulation on a form.<br /><br />E.J. has a valid concern about editing a post on the WEB site particularly when only one party has the ability to make the change. Rather than editing/removing a post, a better procedure would be to post an amendment or correction.</div>

				<div class="content">Hey ej, buddy, dont get me wrong, I totally get why you like nobody to know who you are online, I happen to like being able to speak my mind too without having to be PC and all.  Thats how you and me get to have this fun conversation! But as a covert renegade, at least I’m smart enough to know better than to post serious questions and expect a serious answer. You gotta get that concept through your skull or youre gonna be one frustrated muther efer!<br /><br />Seriously dude, heres a little tip from your pirate friend... if you really have such a high and mighty interest, go off line and ask Steve directly. You got him pinned down because he says he knows it all  and already said he would tell you. Then you can do this huge service you are all bent out of shape about and tell all us other Joes what he said! Is that simple enough for you or are you retarded?<br /><br />Either that or STFU for now and go to the meeting and ask as many questions as you want there because it looks pretty clear that you aint gonna get it here staying all undercover and s**T.<br />I’m not calling you names but you should pay more attention to what our cousin Forrest said... Stupid is as stupid does!</div>
