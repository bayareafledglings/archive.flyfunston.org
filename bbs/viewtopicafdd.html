				<div class="content">All,<br /><br />As one of the measures we are taking to reduce our current burden on the GGNRA, the board has voted in favor of holding November's monthly club meeting (11/12/13) offsite. We'll meet at the Moose Lodge in Pacifica, located at 776 Bradford Street, Pacifica, CA 94044. <br /><br />Directions: If coming from FWY-280, take Hwy 1 south. Take the Sharp Park Exit (same exit as for the Sharp Park Golf Course). At the foot of the off-ramp, turn left on Bradford and go 0.3 miles. The Moose Lodge will be on the left. <br /><br />Our special use permit does allow us to hold our monthly meetings in our clubhouse, but two different Rangers this year have asked if we would consider holding our meetings offsite during the months when it gets dark early and the park closes early as a result. The Rangers are uncomfortable leaving the gate open when the park is officially closed as this allows uninvited people to enter the park and requires extra patrols to clear the parking lots. We will discuss at the Nov meeting whether it would be prudent for us to hold the next few meetings offsite as well as a goodwill gesture to the GGNRA. <br /><br />The 11/12/13 meeting will start at 7:30 pm as usual. <br /><br />Thank you for your understanding, <br />Tracey</div>
