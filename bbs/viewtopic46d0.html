<br />Attention all contributors to the public lands project!
<br />
<br />Thanks again for your park nominations and ideas for encouraging  the 
<br />National Park Service to adopt a friendlier HG &amp; PG policy. We now  have an 
<br />opportunity to make this project soar after being temporarily  grounded 
<br />while NPS addressed its homeland security and management  priorities.
<br />
<br />NPS now wants public comments on its  new 2006 Management Policies 
<br />proposal. A big public response for a policy  favoring HG &amp; PG as 
<br />appropriate park uses will improve our chances for  success and spillover to 
<br />other federal, state &amp; local public lands -  as the NPS goes so may go the 
<br />others.
<br />
<br />In  1982, last time NPS worked on nationwide proposal for footlaunch 
<br />powerless  flight, it received ONLY TWO positive responses. As a consequence 
<br />the NPS  adopted a restrictive policy that prohibits HG &amp; PG unless a  
<br />superintendent obtains a Special Use Regulation via a cumbersome process  
<br />that often takes years and extensive park resources. This understandably  
<br />discourages new site opportunities, wastes taxpayer resources, delays  
<br />permitting decisions, and explains why less than a dozen parks (out of  
<br />hundreds possible!) have this regulation!
<br />
<br />This  time we must flood the NPS mailboxes with public comments urging 
<br />an  HG/PG-friendly policy. A sample letter and how to send it are shown 
<br />below.  Better yet, write your own letter for a more personal touch. The 
<br />more  letters the NPS receives, the better. And you don't have to be a pilot 
<br />to  respond. So make extra copies for your family, friends, co-workers,  
<br />associates, etc. to send in. Do it now! Numbers count! Timing is critical!  
<br />FEBRUARY 18, 2006 DEADLINE!

<br />SUGGESTED LETTER:
<br />Dear Mr. Fagan:
<br />
<br />In response to the  proposed 2006 NPS Management Policies, hang gliding and 
<br />paragliding are  fully in keeping with the NPS's goals and efforts for 
<br />conserving park  resources and values. These recreational activities have 
<br />historically had  no more - and often less - adverse impact than most 
<br />traditionally-accepted  activities like backpacking and hiking.
<br />
<br />National parks are often the  best or only terrain suitable for footlaunch 
<br />powerless flight. Yet hang  gliding and paragliding are prohibited unless a 
<br />superintendent obtains a  Special Use Regulation through a cumbersome 
<br />process that often takes years  and extensive park resources. This is a 
<br />burden to the NPS, park managers,  and the powerless flying community.
<br />
<br />I urge the NPS to adopt a  friendlier policy that does not require a Special 
<br />Use Regulation before  this low adverse impact form of recreation
<br />is allowed in a park. Powerless  flight should be determined by the park 
<br />manager and the hang gliding and  paragliding community.
<br />
<br />Sincerely,
<br />
<br />Your Name &amp; Address

<br />Dear Mr./Ms. Hart:
<br />
<br />This will acknowledge receipt of your e-mail below concerning the 
<br />National
<br />Park Service's draft Management Policies currently out for review.  
<br />Your
<br />comments will be given due consideration.  You may be interested to 
<br />know
<br />that we have placed on the Internet a new document that compares the
<br />revised draft with the original 2001 edition.  It is annotated to 
<br />highlight
<br />important changes and to explain the intent behind them.  The 
<br />comparison
<br />can be accessed at &lt;http://www.nps.gov/policy/mp/comparison.pdf&gt;.
<br />
<br />Thank you for taking the time to write to us, and for your interest in 
<br />our
<br />national parks.
<br />
