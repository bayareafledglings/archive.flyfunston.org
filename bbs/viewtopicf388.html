<br />The new H-2 Rules need refinement.
<br />3. Since the H-2 is going to land on the beach, flights should be permitted only when the beach is not crowded. 
<br />

<br />I believe that rules should be objective and not subjective and it would be next to impossible to define &quot;crowded&quot; in any objective sense.
<br />
<br />On the other hand, regard for the existing 25' rule would have both H-2 and Sponsor evaluate the conditions and make the proper decisions.
<br />
<br />I don't think any further rule is needed.</div>

				<div class="content">The fact that an H-2 was fortunate to land more than 25’ from someone on the beach does not mean that it was safe for him to fly. The Rule should state: “The sponsor shall determine that conditions on the beach allow sufficient room for an inexperienced pilot to make a safe landing.” If there isn’t sufficient room, the sponsor and not the H-2 should be held accountable.</div>

				<div class="content">I'd prefer to keep the FF rules as short and as simple as possible. (think WOR, not!) On the other hand, I would not oppose anyone making a motion for this or something like this at an upcoming meeting.
<br />
<br />There are many things that we could make rules about, but rather than have pages and pages of detailed regulations, I think what we really need are some written guidelines for sponsors and mentors.
<br />
<br />They would spell out things like assessing the beach conditions  including tide level, beach goers and other obstructions. Please see next topic.</div>

				<div class="content">Totally. If the H2 rules are more than one short paragraph, I think something is wrong. We all know there's a limit to what someone can remember after sitting under the bush.
