				<div class="content">Farewell to Al Small...<br /><br />For a man whose last name was Small, Al certainly had a BIG heart.  During the years in which we were privileged to have him as a club member, Al gave freely of his time and resources for the benefit of other pilots. <br /><br />Al would come to the Hat Creek Rim work parties and give 100% for the Rim.  It was a pleasure to camp with him in the #2 LZ.  Al was friendly, enthusiastic, and also very modest.<br /><br />Al began flying hang gliders in 1999 at the age of 57!!.  He has flown at dozens of sites all over the U.S.  He was both a foot-launch and tow pilot.  Al was also a member of the Wings of Rogallo.<br /><br />In the spring of 2012, we learned that Al was diagnosed with terminal esophageal cancer and would not be making the April work party.  Al was a man who took care of himself and was in great shape otherwise.  As such, he was able to undergo some very aggressive cancer treatment to &quot;buy&quot; a little more time.  Over the summer, Al flew with us at Fort Funston, Herd Peak, and Hat Creek Rim.  Al could have done anything with his last year on earth, but chose to spend time flying and camping with us.  Al never boasted about his flying, he just went out and did it.<br /><br />Al's last flight was September 2, 2012 at Hat Creek Rim.  He had a great glass-off flight.  The photo shows Al in the #2 LZ after landing.  <a href="http://www.hatcreek.info/" class="postlink">http://www.hatcreek.info/</a><br /><br />Al passed away this last Saturday, 3/16/13.  He will be truly missed.<br /><br /><br />Shasta Sky Sailors</div>
