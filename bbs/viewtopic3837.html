				<div class="content">Hello,
<br />Your email address was in Mike's computer address book, so I'm sending you this invitation.
<br />I'm sorry if this is the first you've heard about Mike's fatal auto accident on Aug. 21st - as I 
<br />know it will be a shock. He was the most wonderful husband and best friend I can imagine.  
<br />I hope you can join us in this celebration of his life.
<br />Wishing you well,
<br />Jain Hutzell-Pelton
<br />
<br />
<br />
