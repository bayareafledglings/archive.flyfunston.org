				<div class="content">Lets Go Tow...<br />Soon anyway...mid Jan?<br />Gregg M. is coming back to the area and I would love to get out to New Jerusalem (by Tracy, CA) for a day (or two if needed) of towing....<br />The weather has been a bit iffy these days, who knows a month +out but I'm up for some fun....any of you?<br />Gregg's rates seem good to me at...<br />    2K AGL     $25.00<br />    3K AGL     $30.00<br />    4K AGL     $50.00<br />    5K AGL     $65.00<br />    Over 5K AGL, just give him your credit card and don't look at the bill !!<br /><br />Also he will do Trike rides for family members if time allows.. generally 125 /hr, but he is always negotiable <img src="images/smilies/icon_smile.html" alt=":)" title="Smile" /><br /><br />He only wants AT rated pilots with some experience to tow....<br />(If you have been out with me, Paul S., Ken Brown. and Gregg let me know (if I don't) and I'll give (remind)him my word for you (if I think I should <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.html" alt=";-)" title="Wink" /> (Same goes for any of Zac's students-they will want to talk to Zac and I about it first)<br />(This is a Trike and not the Dragonfly)<br /><br />Tandems are also a go, so come out and setup a fee with Gregg....<br /><br />I would also expect other Tow systems (scooter?, Platform? ) to come out but will let them chime in on their own. I'm all for it though as that would give non AT rated pilots a reason to come out other than to watch and learn (and record)....<br />Lets have a TOW PARTY....Who Wants to Join Me???<br />Diev<br />(more here <a href="http://www.hanggliding.org/viewtopic.php.html?p=340672#340672" class="postlink">http://www.hanggliding.org/viewtopic.php.html?p=340672#340672</a> )</div>
