				<div class="content">As was discussed at the January club meeting, the membership feels that proposed amendments to the club bylaws should be posted on the Fellow Feathers web site rather than being taped to the clubhouse door. Please see below for the proposed amendment to Article XII, Section 1. These proposed amendments are also currently taped to the clubhouse door, per the current bylaws. The first of two required votes will be at the February 2011 club meeting. Please come to the next two club meetings and vote!<br /><br /><br /><br />The current bylaw reads:<br /><br />ARTICLE XII: AMENDMENTS<br />Section 1: These bylaws may be amended by an affirmative vote of two thirds (2/3) of the members present at two consecutive meetings. When the proposed amendments to the bylaws are five pages or less, they shall be posted in their entirety on the Clubhouse door at least ten days prior to the meetings. If the proposed amendments are more than five pages, notice that there are proposed amendments shall be posted on the door and copies of the proposed amendments shall be placed in a box next to the door. <br /><br />Section 2: At least ten days before the meetings, the proposed amendments shall be e-mailed to those members who have provided the Club with their e-mail addresses.<br /><br />Section 3: Any such amendments must be consistent with the provisions of the<br />Club’s permit agreements and any other requirements, regulations or<br />agreements with state and local governments, other relevant authorities and<br />affiliated organizations.<br /><br /><br />Proposed amendment final language would be:<br /><br />ARTICLE XII: AMENDMENTS<br />Section 1: These bylaws may be amended by an affirmative vote of two thirds (2/3) of the members present at two consecutive meetings. Proposed amendments to the bylaws shall be posted in their entirety on the Fellow Feathers website at least ten days prior to the meetings.<br /><br />Section 2: At least ten days before the meetings, the proposed amendments shall be e-mailed to those members who have provided the Club with their e-mail addresses.<br /><br />Section 3: Any such amendments must be consistent with the provisions of the<br />Club’s permit agreements and any other requirements, regulations or<br />agreements with state and local governments, other relevant authorities and<br />affiliated organizations.</div>

				<div class="content">WEB posting makes sense. More members will see notices on the WEB than on the Clubhouse door. However we need not send notices to all pilots “who have provided the Club with their e-mail addresses.” If for some reason a pilot is not sent a notice, it could invalidate the whole process. WEB posting is sufficient.<br /><br />Because of recent events, we should reconsider requiring our bylaw amendments be consistent with “affiliated organizations”.  USHPA is an affiliated organization.<br /><br />USHPA’s best interests are not necessarily our best interests. USHPA is evolving into a paraglider organization with a paraglider president. Although withdrawn, at their Fall Meeting USHPA Directors voted, apparently unanimously, to impose a gag rule on members, end the independence of local clubs by not allowing them to have policies it considers “detrimental” and to prohibit Fellow Feathers from limiting voting at meetings to pilots regularly flying at Funston.<br /><br />We need to preserve our independence and not require our bylaws be consistent with the changing rules and regulations of an organization over which we have little control and with which we have increasingly little in common.</div>

				<div class="content">Our Technology Officer (Chuck) says we do have the ability to mass email members. That said, it does take a lot of man-hours to manage an email database and keep it current. I agree with your observation that an excluded member could pose a legal issue. All things considered, I support eliminating Section 2.<br /><br />Our bylaws should not conflict with our agreement with the GGNRA, or State or Federal laws, but we certainly could drop the  “affiliated organizations” portion.<br /><br />Dan, would you please post your proposed amendment here and on the clubhouse door so we can vote on it?<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">The entire section requiring bylaws be “consistent” with GGNRA regulations, federal and state laws, etc. is unnecessary. Any bylaw that is inconsistent has no force and effect. It is like having a bylaw requiring flying be consistent with the laws of physics.</div>
