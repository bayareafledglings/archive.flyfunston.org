				<div class="content">Our current insurance situation is critical and will require everyone's involvement if we want to keep Fort Funston open for hang gliding.<br />The club needs to complete a risk assessment and safety action plan, and do whatever it takes to keep the site accident free.<br /><br />We have rules in place to accomplish the job, but now more than ever, they need to be strictly observed and enforced. Any pilot worth their rating should not have a problem!<br /><br />Please come to Tuesdays meeting to hear all about our situation and how it will affect your flying at the Fort.</div>

				<div class="content">The two main safety issues discussed at the April club meeting were observing the 25' rule and taking care of parked gliders so they don't blow over.<br /><br />Parking gliders: Keep an eye out for changing wind direction and velocity. Remember that you glider might have been sheltered by a glider that has since moved! Take the incentive to re-park any glider you see that is in danger of blowing over and keep them tucked against the bush.<br /><br />25' Rule: Spectators and pedestrians are our biggest risk and MUST be avoided. There is now a row of orange cones 25' back from the sand trail to form a safety buffer zone. If there are people on the sand trail you MUST land outside the buffer zone or risk suspension. Also, do not fly over pedestrians lower than 25'. This is crucial and people will be watching! If there are just no breaks in pedestrian traffic or if you are getting too low to top land safely, keep flying or go to the beach. If a pilot lands on the beach, show your support of their wise and responsible decision by helping them carry their gear back up!<br /><br />Remember, one more big lawsuit and you can kiss the Fort goodbye.</div>
