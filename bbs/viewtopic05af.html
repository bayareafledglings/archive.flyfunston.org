				<div class="content">How about that New Years Day UFC? Clay Guida sure is entertaining, all that capoeira or whatever the hell he was doing. I thought I remembered him bigger though - he must have dropped a weight class after the last time I saw him getting his ass kicked a year or so ago. I haven't kept up with it well enough to be sure. I just download the shows a week or month later to watch them and sometimes don't.<br /><br />Dave</div>
