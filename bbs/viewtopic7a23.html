<br />Hull Mountain Fly In  19th - 20th Sept
<br />
<br />The &quot;Hull Mountain Fly In&quot; is an informal and fun and free event to encourage qualified fliers to test their skills in six categories. Each category is worth 100 points - 
<br />
<br />1) Launch technique, Olympic style judging. Penalties for all sorts of things , including farting, having things fall out of your harness after launching, how many times in your launch run you change your hand positions etc. Gotta be good! 
<br />2) Duration - longest flight 
<br />3) Spot landing - how many hang gliders can fit on the head of pin? 
<br />4) Altitude - did you get high today? Show us. 
<br />5) Streamer drop. Can you drop a streamer in a pickle barrel from 30,000ft? Well then try 200ft. 
<br />6) Landing. Olympic style judging ( this time with more judges who may / or may not have been partying for some time before you land. You'd better be good. 
<br />
<br />There will be winners. Maybe even some token prizes!! 
<br />
<br />Token prize donations are welcome. 
<br />
<br />Free flying on Sunday, though we easily have another comp with more prizes.. 
<br />
<br />Fall flying at Hull is often really good. See you there. 
<br />
<br />Kudos to Charley Warren - who came up with the whole idea.
