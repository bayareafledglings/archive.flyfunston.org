This<br />corporation shall, to the fullest extent of the law, indemnify any person who was or is a<br />party or is threatened to be made a party to any proceeding (other than an action by or<br />in the right of this corporation to procure a judgment in its favor, an action brought<br />under Corporations Code section 5233 made applicable pursuant to Section 7238, or<br />an action brought by the Attorney General or a person granted relator status by the<br />Attorney General for any breach of duty relating to assets held in charitable trust), by<br />reason of the fact that such person is or was an agent of this corporation, against<br />expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably<br />incurred in connection with such proceeding if such person acted in good faith and in a<br />manner such person reasonably believed to be in the best interests of this corporation<br />and, in the case of a criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the<br />conduct of such person was unlawful. The termination of any proceeding by<br />judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its<br />equivalent shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good<br />faith and in a manner which the person reasonably believed to be in the best interests<br />of this corporation or that the person had reasonable cause to believe that the person's<br />conduct was unlawful.<br />Section 3: Indemnification in Actions by or in the Right of this<br />Corporation. This corporation shall, to the fullest extent of the law, have the power to<br />indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any<br />threatened, pending, or completed action by or in the right of this corporation, or<br />brought under Corporations Code section 5233 made applicable pursuant to Section<br />7238, or brought by the Attorney General or a person granted relator status by the<br />Attorney General for breach of duty relating to assets held in charitable trust, to<br />procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that such person is or was an<br />agent of this corporation, against expenses actually and reasonably incurred by such<br />person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action if such person acted<br />in good faith, in a manner such person believed to be in the best interests of this<br />corporation, and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, as an ordinarily prudent<br />person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. No indemnification<br />shall be made under Section 3:<br />(a) In respect of any claim, issue, or matter as to which such<br />person shall have been adjudged to be liable to this corporation in the<br />performance of such person's duty to this corporation, unless and only to the<br />extent that the court in which such proceeding is or was pending shall<br />determine upon application that, in view of all the circumstances of the case,<br />such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for the expenses<br />which such court shall determine;<br />(b) Of amounts paid in settling or otherwise disposing of a<br />threatened or pending action, with or without court approval; or<br />(c) Of expenses incurred in defending a threatened or pending<br />action which is settled or otherwise disposed of without court approval, unless<br />it is settled with the approval of the Attorney General.<br />Section 4: Indemnification Against Expenses.

Except as provided in<br />Section 4 of this Article, any indemnification under this Article shall be made<br />by this corporation only if authorized in the specific case, upon a determination that<br />indemnification of the agent is proper in the circumstances because the agent has met<br />the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 2 or 3 of this Article by:<br />(a) A majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors who are<br />not parties to such proceeding;<br />(b) Approval of the members, with the persons to be indemnified<br />not being entitled to vote thereon; or<br />(c) The court in which such proceeding is or was pending upon<br />application made by this corporation or the agent or the attorney or other person<br />rendering services in connection with the defense, whether or not such<br />application by the agent, attorney, or other person is opposed by this<br />corporation.<br />Section 6: Advance of Expenses. Expenses incurred by a person<br />seeking indemnification under this Article in defending any proceeding covered by<br />this Article may be advanced by this corporation prior to the final disposition of such<br />proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the agent to repay such<br />amount unless it shall be determined ultimately that the agent is entitled to be<br />indemnified as authorized in this Article.	<br />Section 7: Other Indemnification. No provision made by this<br />corporation to indemnify its or its subsidiary's directors or officers for the defense of<br />any proceeding, whether contained in the Articles, these Bylaws, a resolution of<br />members or directors, an agreement, or otherwise, shall be valid unless consistent with<br />this Article. Nothing contained in this Article shall affect any right to<br />indemnification to which persons other than such directors and officers may be entitled<br />by contract or otherwise.<br />Section 8: Forms of Indemnification Not Permitted. No<br />indemnification or advance shall be made under this Article, except as provided<br />in Section 4 or 5(b) of this Article, in any circumstances where it appears:<br />(a) That it would be inconsistent with a provision of the Articles,<br />these Bylaws, a resolution of the members, or an agreement in effect at the time<br />of the accrual of the alleged cause of action asserted in the proceeding in which<br />the expenses were incurred or other amounts were paid, which prohibits or<br />otherwise limits indemnification; or<br />(b) That it would be inconsistent with any condition expressly<br />imposed by a court in approving a settlement.<br />Section 9:  Insurance. This corporation shall have the power to<br />purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any agent of this corporation against any<br />liability asserted against or incurred by the agent in such capacity or arising out of the<br />agent's status as such whether or not this corporation would have the power to<br />indemnify the agent against such liability under the provisions of this Article.<br />Section 10: Nonapplicability to Fiduciaries of Employee Benefit Plans.<br />This Article does not apply to any proceeding against any trustee, investment<br />manager or other fiduciary of an employee benefit plan in such person's capacity as<br />such, even though such person may also be an agent of this corporation as defined in<br />Section 1 of this Article. This corporation shall have power to indemnify such<br />trustee, investment manager or other fiduciary to the extent permitted by<br />subdivision (f) of Section 207 of the California General Corporation Law.</div>
