				<div class="content">In reference to the above:<br /><br />There was a discussion during our June club meeting about making changes to the FF rules more fair. That is, by giving everyone more advance notice of a proposed change, and having it voted on over two meetings just like we do for a Bylaws change.<br /><br /> The first of two votes on this proposal will take place at the August 6th club meeting. If you would like to participate be sure to contact me for a Zoom invite: steve [at] skypuppy (dot) us<br />PS: I might have missed a recent invite request, so feel free to double check with me to make sure you will be added. Thanks!</div>
