				<div class="content">Barbara Chavez, the beloved wife of Dave Chavez, died last week after a long battle with cancer. Dave was a one of the first pilots to fly at Funston and was an outstanding pilot for many years. I believe he  was the first pilot to soar the cliff. Soaring in those days was flying to the north end, making a 180 and landing on the beach.<br /><br />     At one time at Funston there was a limit on the number of gliders in the air. Monitors were appointed to make certain the limit was observed. Barbara was a monitor and many a pilot heard those dread words from her. “YOU DOWN”. We landed immediately.</div>
