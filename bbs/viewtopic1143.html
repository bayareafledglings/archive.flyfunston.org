				<div class="content">In response to David Royer's comment here ( <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopic0825.html?t=450">http://flyfunston.org/bbs/viewtopic.php.html?t=450</a><!-- m --> ) I wanted to elevate the visibility of this topic.  It's important that we be completely clear and transparent about the clubhouse procedures and waiting list. 
<br />
<br />Meeting minutes from April 10, 2007 are here: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="viewtopicff01.html?t=452">http://flyfunston.org/bbs/viewtopic.php.html?t=452</a><!-- m -->
<br />
<br />Now my comments:
<br />
<br />1. We discussed what &quot;active&quot; means last year and came to the conclusion that 3 times per year is sufficient to keep the clubhouse spots rotating.  The clubhouse form used this year is online at <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../flyfunston.org/documents/clubhousemembership_10_10_06.html">http://flyfunston.org/documents/clubhou ... _10_06.doc</a><!-- m --> (correct me if I'm wrong, Chris).  the original proposal was for 6 times/year but we eventually settled on 3.   
<br />
<br />2. Glider delivery is not sustainable in the long term.  We should stick with something we can actually deliver on, or people won't believe we're going to take action. If people want their gliders, they will come pick them up.  The club should provide ample notice to inactive pilots (email, letter, phone, word of mouth - all are necessary for hard-to-find pilots) then put the glider into <span style="font-style: italic">purgatory</span> - the temporary storage area at the top of the clubhouse.  Once a year, or every two years, we should have a glider auction.  <span style="font-weight: bold">It was amazing to see how many people retrieved their abandoned gliders when the auction was about to happen</span>.  
<br />
<br />3. The waiting list should be publicly available, not on a piece of paper in someone's pocket.  I'd prefer it be on this forum, but I'd take a printed list on the wall in the clubhouse.  The reason we were able to clean up the clubhouse so well in the last couple of years is that we were open and organized about who had what where.
<br />
<br />4. For the record, the current club policy on &quot;double spaces&quot; is that anyone who currently has two spaces is allowed to keep both. Nobody will be granted a second space if they already have one.  
<br />
<br />Thanks to all for making the clubhouse work.
<br />
<br />Daniel</div>
