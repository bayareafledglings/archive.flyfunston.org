				<div class="content">Hi all,
<br />
<br />I hate having to do this.  I really do.
<br />
<br />On Monday I suspended one pilot for a week.  I like the guy, but he landed long with many, many pedestrians crossing the path.  He actually landed a few feet from of the path (practically on the fence) to the sound of several pilots yelling at the passers-by to watch out.  Several pedestrians had to run out of the way.  
<br />
<br />The specific club rule he violated is: 
<br />
<br />2. No pilot may fly within 25' of any person on the ground. 
<br />(from <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../../flyfunston.org/rules.html">http://flyfunston.org/rules.php.html</a><!-- m --> )
<br />
<br />The pilot is on a new glider with a new harness and he admits to having trouble getting acclimated.  I took him aside to give him the suspension – I’m not here to embarrass him, just to make sure he understands the gravity of running into the innocents.  
<br />
<br />One of the reasons the GGNRA trusts us to administer ourselves is that we have a good track record of ensuring our own safety and that of the other park visitors.  
<br />
<br />Pilots in command are also responsible for ensuring nobody is coming across the walkway when you decide to land on the wood chips, so please look both ways before crossing the path.  
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />Daniel</div>
