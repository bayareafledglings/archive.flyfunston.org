				<div class="content">Proposal to revise Fellow Feathers rule # 5<br /><br />Background: Due to recent accidents, the GGNRA is closely monitoring hang gliding at Fort Funston. To keep the Fort open to hang gliding, it is essential that the Fellow Feathers pays utmost attention to safety and accident prevention.<br />Our GGNRA Special Use Permit specifically states: “Stunt flying and aerobatics are prohibited within the permittee’s designated area at Fort Funston.”<br /><br />Our members need clarity as to where this area is, and some of the language in our rules confuses the matter by specifically describing the launch window. Part of Rule # 5 reads:<br />“Pilots may not perform aerobatic maneuvers in, or otherwise obstruct, the launch window. The launch window is from the sand trail just south of launch to the north end of the observation deck, 100' above and 25’ below launch, and from launch out to the surf line.”<br /><br />By specifying the launch window, it makes it sound like the only place that aerobatics are prohibited is in the launch window, when in actuality they are prohibited everywhere at Fort Funston.<br />To make it clear, I propose that we revise Rule # 5 by replacing the launch window definition with the following: “Pilots may not perform aerobatic maneuvers anywhere in the area from the south end of the Training Bowl up to Sloat Blvd.”<br /><br />Here is the full language:<br /><br />Existing Rule # 5: “Stunt flying and aerobatics are prohibited at Fort Funston. Pilots may not perform aerobatic maneuvers in, or otherwise obstruct, the launch window. The launch window is from the sand trail just south of launch to the north end of the observation deck, 100' above and 25’ below launch, and from launch out to the surf line. Aerobatic maneuvers will be defined as any turn with a bank angle in excess of 60 degrees, or where the pitch attitude of the glider exceeds 30 degrees above or below horizontal.”<br /><br />Proposed Rule # 5: “Stunt flying and aerobatics are prohibited at Fort Funston. Pilots may not perform aerobatic maneuvers anywhere in the area from the south end of the Training Bowl up to Sloat Blvd. Aerobatic maneuvers will be defined as any turn with a bank angle in excess of 60 degrees, or where the pitch attitude of the glider exceeds 30 degrees above or below horizontal.”<br /><br />The first vote on this proposed change will be held during the April 1, 2021 club meeting (on Zoom). If you are not yet signed up to receive meeting invites, please contact our club president Jessica Koerner: pres [at] flyfunston (dot) org<br /><br />Cheers!</div>
