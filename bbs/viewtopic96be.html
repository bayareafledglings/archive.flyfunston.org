<br />
<br />Please come to the next club meeting and help guide our club into the new year.
<br />Among other things, we will vote on two proposals that will change our Bylaws.
<br />The following has been posted in the clubhouse door announcement box;
<br />
<br />Notice: A proposal has been made to resolve an inconsistency in the numbering of certain club bylaws. The established format is; Article (by Roman numeral), Section (by number), Paragraph (by alphabet letter), Line (by number).
<br />The inconsistency appears under Article V: Officers (Executive Committee), where the Section describing responsibilities of Officers is improperly numbered Roman numeral “VI”, when it should be numbered (Section) 3.
<br />As a result of this mistake all the subsequent Bylaws Articles have the wrong Roman numeral in relation to Article V.
<br />
<br />Proposal; 
<br />1)	Change what is now “Section VI” to read “Section 3”.
<br />2)	 Renumber the Articles after Article V to be in consecutive numerical order as follows; Article VI Special Committees, Article VII Removal from Office, Article VIII Fiscal Year, Article IX Discipline, Article X Amendments.
<br />
<br />Notice: A proposal has been made to change to the club bylaws by eliminating the officer position of “Westlake Director” and adding the officer position of “Technology Officer”. 
<br />
<br />Proposal;
<br />
<br />1)	Revise Article V, section 1 to read; “The officers consist of the President, Vice President, Secretary, Treasurer, Technology Officer, Safety Director and Clubhouse Manager.
<br />
<br />2)	Revise Section 3,E, (otherwise known as Section VI,E), to read; “Technology Officer is responsible for maintaining, repairing and upgrading the telephone wind talker, weather station, webcams and supporting computers and networks, as well as maintaining and updating the club website <!-- w --><a class="postlink" href="../index.html">www.Flyfunston.org</a><!-- w -->.
<br />
<br />
<br />These proposals will be voted on at the next two club meetings scheduled for January 6 and February 10, 2009. All members are encouraged to attend.</div>
