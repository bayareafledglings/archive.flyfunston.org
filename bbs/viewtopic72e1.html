And, if you are injured at Funston, remember that<br />  emergency services will have a hard time getting to you with the gates closed.</li><li> Danny's girlfriend's parents own a property w/ cell towers, bathrooms, and<br />  some pilot has been flying there for quite some time. He's going to check it<br />  out. (This is about as much as he knows about it - he's not even sure if the<br />  current pilot is a hang or para.)</li></ul><br />Treasurer/GGNRA Liason Report (Steve Rodrigues)<br /><ul><li> No news from the park on the reopening.</li><li> Regarding the sandbag burm and the request to replace it with asphault: GGNRA<br />  are in the process of replacing the entire lot, so we're working with them in<br />  the hopes of the new lot eliminating the issue.</li><li> Some discussion about being (illegitimately) ticketed at Funston.</li><li> $20,399.32, minus $12k roofing = $8,399.32</li><li> There was a discussion about taking Venmo/PayPal for their dues. This expanded<br />  to a discussion about making the form and payment entirely electronic. There<br />  was a short conversation about eliminating stickers, but a few spoke up that<br />  it's nice to be able to ID an authorized pilot by just looking at their<br />  helmet.<br />  <ul>  <li> Steve will look into Venmo's options for the club - what it'll cost in <br />    xaction fees, etc., and report next month.<br />  </li></ul></li><li> Steve contacted the top 5 people on the dual-occupancy list to see if one<br />  wanted to give up their slot, pro-actively, and Joey volunteered.</li></ul><br />President (Isaiah)<br /><ul><li> Nothing to report</li></ul><br />VP (Ron)<br /><ul><li> No new applications.</li></ul><br />Clubhouse (Rob)<br /><ul><li> Rob'll contact the few remaning unpaid clubhouse users to get them to send in<br />  their dues.</li></ul><br />Safety (Brad)<br /><ul><li> Nothing to report</li></ul><br />Tech (George)<br /><ul><li> Graphs aren't showing up on the website.</li></ul></div>
