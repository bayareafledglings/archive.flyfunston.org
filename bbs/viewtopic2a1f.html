				<div class="content">Dear Fellow Feathers,
<br />
<br />You’ll soon be receiving your October issue of Hang Gliding &amp; Paragliding Magazine with the announcement of the upcoming elections for Regional Director of USHPA.  The Current Director for Region 2 whose term expires in December, Jim Macklow, has decided to not run again.  There are two people on the ballot this time; me and Jon James.
<br />
<br />For those who don’t know me, let me tell you a little about myself.  I’m now into my 20th year as a hang glider pilot and have been active in WOR and the USHPA.  To support WOR, I give the WOR hang gliding Observer and Instructor clinics.  I have been an Examiner for the USHPA for a long time and I appoint nearly all of the hang gliding Observers in the South Bay.  I have also been active in USHPA in other ways, although never before as a Regional Director.  I attended the last BOD meeting in Colorado Springs, representing Region 2 for a Director who could not attend.  I plan on participating at this year’s BOD meeting.  I am currently a member of the Marketing and Development committee of USHPA, and its sub-committee, Internal Marketing.
<br />
<br />You’ll find some additional information about me in the October magazine.  If you would like any further information or would like to make other comments, please contact me.
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />Dave Wills</div>
