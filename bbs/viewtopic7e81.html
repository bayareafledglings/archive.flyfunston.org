<br />DALY CITY: COAST GUARD RESCUES STRANDED HANG GLIDER
<br />DALY CITY (BCN)
<br />
<br />The U.S. Coast Guard saved a stranded hang glider Sunday after he
<br />crashed on a cliff in Daly City near Mussel Rock, according to the
<br />U.S. Coast Guard.
<br />The Coast Guard responded with a helicopter around 7 p.m. after it was
<br />determined that the fire department could not reach the man.
<br />A rescuer was lowered to the cliff and hoisted the man so he could be
<br />transferred to the beach, where paramedics were waiting, the Coast
<br />Guard reported.
<br />The man was not injured, according to the Coast Guard.</div>

<br />
<br />1.  The purpose of posting was to GAIN and share correct information in a discussion thread.  As you can see, what I posted was clipped from a coast guard report, not my own words.  A bulletin board is a good place to talk as a community about safety and other incidents affecting us in the sport, particularly locally.  I didn't see another thread about this, so....  <img src="images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif" alt=":roll:" title="Rolling Eyes" />
<br />
<br />2.  Not sure what you're referring to about the first time I've posted &quot;incorrect&quot; info, but rather than yelling the first thing that pops into your mind, perhaps you could elaborate with details and something a little more constructive?  If I've erred in the past, you could be a bit more specific (or better yet, have a private conversation with me).
<br />
<br />Thanks for the correction of the news item re: paragliding pilot.  Anyone with additional info on this incident might still like to discuss, regardless.
<br />
<br />Hugs and kisses,
<br />Jason</div>
