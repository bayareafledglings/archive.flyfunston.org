				<div class="date"><img src="styles/prosilver/imageset/icon_post_target.gif" width="11" height="9" alt="Post" title="Post" />Posted: <strong>Wed Aug 14, 2019 11:38 pm</strong></div>

				<div class="content">Present;<br /><ul><li> Rob Racer</li><li> John Simpson</li><li> Bill</li><li> Brad Martin</li><li> Steve Rodrigues</li><li> Ron</li></ul><br /><ul><li> Some discussion of the issues with the Ring cameras. They're a pain<br />in the ass to use. Their resolution is so poor you can't recognize<br />faces, even when they're 2 meters from the camera. We discussed the<br />possibility of returning them and replacing them with... ?</li><li> Can we zoom in a bit to get better resolution, so we can at least <br />be able to ID faces? The issue may also (did some poking around online)<br />be related to the wifi connection quality.</li></ul><br />Rob - President<br /><ul><li> BBQ and air races coming up on August 31.<br />  <ul>  <li> Steve will get the announcement up on the website.<br />  </li><li> Tshirts are dealt with.<br />  </li><li> Most likely dogs, burgers, and something vegan.<br />  </li></ul></li><li> Clubhouse needs to be painted. Work party September 7. Crappy<br />  weather = postpone. If the forecast looks good, we need to do the<br />  powerwash a few days in advance.</li><li> Rob'll go through all the BBQ supplies in the clubhouse to see what<br />  we need to pick up.</li></ul><br />Treasurer<br /><ul><li> Exceeding expected income. Previous year income about 9600, to date,<br />  we have 9987 in membership &amp; donations. We've lowered expenses by<br />  going to AT&amp;T (420/year savings). 60/mo savings for meetings in<br />  clubhouse.</li><li> $19502.23 bank balance. Minus 12k roofing fund, $7502.23 remain. We've<br />  already paid the GGNRA district charge (our rent.)</li><li> Added a self-propelled mower to the budget. We're figuring it'll last<br />  a couple years. Allocated $170/year.</li><li> Two unpaid members (would bring another $150.)</li><li> Everyone HAS TO HAVE THEIR NAME ON THEIR GLIDER. People are squatting in<br />  slots that are supposed to be vacant and it's costing us income. We should<br />  have 4 open slots, so please advertize.</li></ul><br />Clubhouse <br />[*] see above<br /><br />Safety<br />[*] Nothing to report.</div>
