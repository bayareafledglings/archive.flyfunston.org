				<div class="content">The Free Flight Seminar Series continues.  Please join us Wednesday, March 17th, 7:00pm at the Variety Theater, 582 Market St. (at Market &amp; 2nd) downtown San Francisco for the second seminar in the series.  The topics being discussed at this seminar include;  Vario/GPS instruments, Paraglider Aerobatics, Hang Glider Aerobatics and upcoming Bay Area Paragliding Association events.  The film festival begins at 9:00pm and as always, beer &amp; food will be provided. (KEG, need i say more!)
<br />
<br />In conjunction with the speakers we plan to have an organized film festival at each event with interested folks submitting a film, 7 minutes or less, which will be evaluated by the audience as well as a panel of judges.   All films will be posted on a Norcal Free Flight Film Festival HD Vimeo channel after each event.  At year end a final event will be held, the best films will be reviewed and a final winner will be selected.
<br />
<br />Please forward this on to all interested videographers, encouraging them to email jose9878 at yahoo.com if interested in participating in the film festival. 
<br />
<br />Please join us for a fun evening celebrating the norcal free flight communities talent!
<br />
<br />ps- there might be some paragliders in the crowd, so bring baseball bats, etc, for protection..</div>
