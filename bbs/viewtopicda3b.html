Their previous appointment had finished an hour early, so they were there when I got there a half-hour ahead of time and I didn't have a chance to remove the gas can. It wasn't an issue, though. The audit was strictly advisory and nothing that comes out of it is used punitively in any way.<br /><br />The auditor had a few preliminary observations, but said we should wait until we get the full report to put anything into action;<br />* If the gas cans are to remain on-site, they should be stored in a fire cabinet.<br />* We need to be sure that mower oil, when it's changed, is properly recycled. (There wasn't any indication that this was an issue, she just wanted to be sure we knew.)<br />* Paint, also, (latex, oil-based, spray cans) has to be recycled per California procedures.<br />* Fluorescent tubes can be recycled through GGNRA's facilities. Used and unused tubes have storage requirements that they'll get for us.<br />* She asked about batteries and I said that I didn't know of any batteries that we'd be disposing of, other than what pilots put in their varios, which doesn't apply to the parameters of the audit. We could put out a recycling bin for them, but that would require that someone go through special training. Yeah, weird.<br />* They will ask us to have Material Safety Data Sheets for most of the chem stuff on-site.<br /><br />That's about it...</div></blockquote><br /><br />Treasurer (Steve)<br /><ul><li> Chapter report &amp; applications are done.</li><li> Issue with the forum spammer has been resolved by locking out requests for membership.</li><li> $13,991 - $12,000 for the roofing fund leaves us $1,991. </li></ul><br />Tech (George)<br /><ul><li> </li></ul></div>
