<br />
<br />Webcam
<br />•	Daniel has done nothing on the new webcam
<br />
<br />Clubhouse
<br />• Purgatory:
<br />  o Still missing Louise’s XC
<br />  o	Found the glider Diev was flying
<br />  o	Found Louise’s 
<br />  o	Missing a WW Sport
<br />  o	Found owners of 2 of the gliders
<br />  o	We only know about the owners of 4 gliders
<br />•	Chris to give light receipts to Attila
<br />•	Graffiti – Chris to paint over the graffiti
<br />•	Steve Rodrigues locked up the gliders in purgatory
<br />
<br />Incorporation
<br />•	Crestline has received 501(c)(3) status.  We have their Articles of Incorporation and can use them as a model.
<br />•	Brian Foster to proceed with the process. Daniel to send all correspondence to Brian;  cc: Steve Rodrigues
<br />
<br />
<br />New Business:
<br />
<br />GGNRA Building
<br />•	Loss of Presidio building for maintenance
<br />•	We have had this building since at least 1977
<br />•	Urs and Daniel to meet with the GGNRA tomorrow for an update on what they want to do and how we can work together
<br />
<br />Chips
<br />•	only getting good chips from now on
<br />
<br />Clubhouse
<br />•	How do we get unused gliders out of the clubhouse?
<br />•	Based on living locally?
<br />•	Based on frequency of flying? How frequently?
<br />•	Cross reference stickers with spots to see who flies frequently
<br />•	Start in 2007
<br />•	We need to account for people who have gliders here in the clubhouse but fly other gliders
<br />•	Great Idea: seal the zipper/zip tie the glider so we know which gliders haven’t been flown</div>
