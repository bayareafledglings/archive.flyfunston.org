				<div class="content">Hey Dave, 
<br />
<br />Glad you found the board.  I'm thinking right now that there are already too many bulletin boards for clubs in the Bay Area.  It's a pain in the arse to keep track of all the discussions.  
<br />
<br />So I'm thinking that we should keep this BBS for minutes and TReports and just let you fly your shit in person <img src="images/smilies/icon_wink.html" alt=";-)" title="Wink" />.  What are you, an S4 now?  I'm only an S2, so I can't fly my shit at Funston without a sponsor.

				<div class="content">Hey you guys
<br />  I tend to go along with Dave there. I think it would be neat to have a forum at Funston. I have no interest in other sites stuff so I wouldn't waste my time going to thier site and I really would feel silly posting a complaint about something stupid going on at Funston on another sites bulletin board anyway. 
<br />  Think of all the hostility at Funston. It would be like pouring gasoline on a fire. This could start a war!

				<div class="content">i guess gene gets the point...who gives a rats ass about other sites ...this is for funston.....keeping some dialogue going is a good idea...this would also help our local pilots do stuff like organize trips, sell gliders etc....the message board is hidden...it should appear on the home page where the web cam is located....i know we share that page w/the paraglider folks..but even that would be good so we could open up some dialogue w/them....even though we all know their opinons don't mean much to us <img src="images/smilies/icon_exclaim.gif" alt=":!:" title="Exclamation" /></div>

				<div class="content">Fair enough.  Let's try it out.  
<br />
<br />After the chute clinic I'll be spending some time reorganizing the web site.  The plan is to leave the webcam where it is and move all the Funston-related pages to flyfunston.org.  I'll make sure to include links to this bbs.  The bbs will include a discussion forum, a meeting minutes and treas. report forum, and a for road trip forum. Beyond that I'm open to suggestions.  I only check this bbs every now and then, so if you want to get hold of me send email to <!-- e --><a href="mailto:vp@flyfunston.org">vp@flyfunston.org</a><!-- e -->.

<br />I believe topics should be mainly related to Funstan-Westlake or Funstan Pilots, with a possible brief FYI link to link to anther BBS for things that might affect Funston pilots.</div>
