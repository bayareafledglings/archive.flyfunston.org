				<div class="content">I'm moving up to SF from the South Bay and would like to start flying at Funston on a semi-regular basis.  The place I'm moving into has no space for glider storage.  Does anybody have any suggestions for convenient places in the city, preferably close to Funston, to store a glider?  I have been trying to get information about storing a glider at the clubhouse from the officers, but so far I haven't gotten a definitive answer, and my impression is that the waiting list is very long.  Please feel free to reply here or e-mail me directly at inverarity at gmail dot com.<br /><br />Thanks!</div>

				<div class="content">Fill out the voting member forms with membership fee, log 20 hours at Funston within the last year, and then contact the clubhouse manager to be put on the clubhouse waiting list. I don't think you'll have to wait long.<br /><br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="../documents/2010/Voting%20member%20package%2011-10-09.html">http://flyfunston.org/documents/2010/Vo ... -10-09.pdf</a><!-- m --><br /><br />Dave</div>

				<div class="content">Yeah, logging 20 hours of flight is not something that's going to happen overnight, and I have been told by several people (though not the club officers) that the waiting list is about a year.  I need to find an actual accommodation next weekend, or else put it somewhere temporarily, or sell it and take up paragliding.</div>

Contact info at <!-- l --><a class="postlink-local" href="memberlistc6bf.html?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13">memberlist.php.html?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=13</a><!-- l --> .  <br /><br />For the immediate term, you may need to find someone with a spare spot or a garage. <br /><br />For the clubhouse, it usually clears out in one big wave each year when people don't re-up rather than bit by bit, so get on that wait list if you aren't already. <br /><br />As for the 20 hour thing - that's not meant for pilots new to Funston or moving into the area, so don't sweat it too much. <br /><br />Daniel</div>
