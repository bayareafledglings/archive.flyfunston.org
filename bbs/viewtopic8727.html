				<div class="content"><span style="font-weight: bold">Fellow Feathers <br />13 February 2007 <br /><br />Present were: </span>
<br />
<br />Attila
<br />Brian
<br />Chris
<br />Daniel M. + pizza
<br />GwenhaÃ«l
<br />Jason B. (newbie)
<br />Joe J. (newbie)
<br />Rafi
<br />Steve
<br />Ted
<br />Tom
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Misc.: </span>
<br />
<br />-	Daniel M. and Attila discuss (financial) reconciliation matters at length. It seems Daniel's software will add one-more-digit precision after the decimal point.
<br />-	Cheers for Daniel P. and his work on the website and new weather station.
<br />-	People recall Sunday, first real flying day in a long time. Daniel M. went to the beach after the wind died on his way back from Westlake.
<br />-	Brief comment is made about spins and related dangers.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">President report and associated items </span>
<br />
<br />-	Steve reminds all that we need to enforce rules and regulations. To this effect, 30-day suspension is given to a H3, new to the site, who tried to go to Westlake without prior sponsorship/intro and landed abruptly on the plateau between first and second ridges. 
<br />-	One pilot is also suspended for violating the 25-ft clearance rule.
<br />-	Tom reminds that landing process should be started early to allow for corrections should there be spectators in the way.
<br />-	Discussion about rules and regulations enforcement ensues: mentors should more active, information should be easier to find on the website, H3 and newbies will get Westlake form to sign with their regular sticker package. Brian suggests adding a &quot;New to Fort Funston?&quot; page on the website.
<br />-	Zero tolerance? Discretion should be applied, 
<br />however, 
<br />  o	flying rules apply to all pilots
<br />  o	pilots on the ground should not be treated any differently than non-pilots, i.e. it's not because one signed a waiver that it's alright they be whacked in the head by a careless pilot buzzing the launch.
<br />-	Officers should lead by example and all officers should enforce the rules.
<br />-	Cones should be moved back closer to launch (e.g. from corner of bush to fence) so that pedestrians can better identify our area and stay out of it.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Vice-President report and associated items </span>
<br />
<br />-	Chris is transferring clubhouse duties to Rafi.
<br />-	New lock will be installed on 1 March 2007
<br />-	New keys have been mailed.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Treasurer report and associated items </span>
<br />
<br />-	Daniel M. will use bank balance for his reports, beginning with next report.
<br />-	For January, balance: $4568, expenses: $91, clubhouse fees: $430
<br />-	From what I understood, Daniel M. is running a pretty elaborate pyramid scheme...
<br />-	Motion is passed to extend $250 to Urs for his trip to the BOD meeting in Colorado
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Club house and associated items </span>
<br />
<br />-	New lock will be installed on 1 March 2007
<br />-	New keys have been mailed.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Old business</span>
<br />
<br />-	Brian reports that incorporation paperwork is ready, with the exception of club name. It appears we cannot have a &quot;/&quot; in our name. &quot;Fellow Feathers of Fort Funston Hang Gliding Club&quot; is chosen for incorporation purposes. Paperwork should be signed and mailed after next meeting.
<br />
<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">New business</span>
<br />
<br />-	Brian offers to organize Fort Funston Air Race events and is appointed Race Director.
<br />-	Rafi is appointed BBQ Chef.
<br />
<br />Meeting adjourned.</div>
